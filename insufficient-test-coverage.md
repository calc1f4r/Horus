## Vulnerability Title

Insufficient Test Coverage

### Overview


This bug report highlights multiple instances of insufficient test coverage in the codebase of a project. This means that not all possible scenarios and edge cases have been tested, increasing the chances of bugs and vulnerabilities. The report recommends implementing a comprehensive multi-level test suite to address these issues and ensure the system's robustness. The team has partially addressed some of the points raised in the report, but the implementation of a complete test suite is still of high priority.

### Original Finding Content

Throughout the codebase, and in particular in the added changes, multiple instances of insufficient test coverage were identified:

* There are different test suites implemented at the same time, namely Hardhat and Foundry. Maintaining different suites instead of having all under the same one adds friction and error-proneness, and increases the cost for the developer to keep it secure.
* Similar contracts in the protocol use different test suites. In particular, [Universal contracts](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/c5d7541037d19053ce2106583b1b711037483038/test/evm/foundry/local/Universal_Adapter.t.sol#L16) rely on Foundry, while the [Arbitrum](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/c5d7541037d19053ce2106583b1b711037483038/test/evm/hardhat/chain-adapters/Arbitrum_Adapter.ts#L59) contracts rely on Hardhat. Standardizing the tests would allow for testing similar contracts under the same cases, which could be beneficial when finding edge cases or bugs.
* New additions only add 5 single positive overall cases to the suite, leaving many other edge cases untested and not asserting any negative situations.
* The values used for testing the outgoing fees have been [set to zero](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/c5d7541037d19053ce2106583b1b711037483038/test/evm/foundry/local/Universal_Adapter.t.sol#L291), as a result of which the whole fee protection is bypassed.
* Contracts are not fuzzed to find edge cases that could be used for exploits.
* There is a lack of integration with the LayerZero protocol, which requires analyzing its caveats, edge cases, and behaviors, and testing the project under such conditions.

Insufficient testing, while not a specific vulnerability, implies a high probability of additional undiscovered vulnerabilities and bugs. It also exacerbates multiple interrelated risk factors in a complex code base. This includes a lack of complete, implicit specification of the functionality and exact expected behaviors that tests normally provide, which increases the chances of correctness issues being missed. It also requires more effort to establish basic correctness and reduces the effort spent exploring edge cases, thereby increasing the chances of missing complex issues.

Moreover, the lack of repeated automated testing of the full specification increases the chances of introducing breaking changes and new vulnerabilities. This applies to both previously audited code and future changes to currently audited code. Underspecified interfaces and assumptions increase the risk of subtle integration issues which testing could reduce by enforcing an exhaustive specification.

To address these issues, consider implementing a comprehensive multi-level test suite. Such a test suite should comprise contract-level tests with 95%-100% coverage, per chain/layer deployment, and integration tests that test the deployment scripts as well as the system as a whole, along with per chain/layer fork tests for planned upgrades. Crucially, the test suite should be documented in such a way that a reviewer can set up and run all these test layers independently of the development team. Some existing examples of such setups can be suggested for use as reference in a follow-up conversation. In addition, consider merging all the test suites into a single one for better maintenance. Implementing such a test suite should be of very high priority to ensure the system's robustness and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and bugs.

***Update:** Partially resolved in [pull request #1038](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/1038). The team stated:*

> *Addressed these 2 points:*
>
> *- New additions only add 5 single positive overall cases to the suite, leaving many other edge cases untested and not asserting any negative situations.*
>
> *- The values used for testing the outgoing fees have been set to zero, as a result of which the whole fee protection is bypassed.*
>
> *Added multiple new local (unit) test-cases (fee ones were added as part of the fix for issue M-03) as well as a fork test for sending USDT via a `Universal_Adapter`. A fork test can be run with this command:*
>
> *`NODE_URL_1=<your-ethereum-rpc-url> forge test --match-path test/evm/foundry/fork/UniversalAdapterOFT.t.sol`*
