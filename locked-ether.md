## Vulnerability Title

Locked Ether

### Overview


Description:
The Collection contract inherits from ERC721A.sol, which has payable functions that allow users to send ETH (native tokens) to the contract. This can lead to ETH being locked permanently in the contract, as there is no function to withdraw funds. This bug was caused by modifications made to the base ERC721A.sol contract. 

Proof of Concept:
After successfully minting tokens, the owner of the NFT can call the approve function in the ERC721A.sol contract, which is one of the payable functions inherited by the Collection contract. This allows them to send ETH to the contract.

BVSS:
The BVSS score for this bug is 6.3, which means that it has a medium impact and can be exploited with moderate difficulty.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to create a withdraw function with access control, allowing authorized parties or administrators to safely withdraw any remaining ETH in the contract. Additionally, it is not recommended to make modifications to the base ERC721A.sol contract as it can introduce bugs and vulnerabilities.

Remediation Plan:
The NFTfi team has implemented a suggested fix for this issue. The fix can be found at https://github.com/NFTfi-Genesis/eth.gen-art/commit/6e5e3636dc2fca07a699078a444646baac1ecdac.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description

The `Collection` contract inherits from `ERC721A.sol`, which carries `payable` functions on its original implementation, influenced by [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). Specifically, the functions are: `approve`, `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId)` and `safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, _data)`, as follows:

- ERC721A.sol (v.4.2.3) [Line: 425]

```
    function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public payable virtual override {
```

  

- ERC721A.sol (v.4.2.3) [Lines: 540-544]

```
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public payable virtual override {
```

  

- ERC721A.sol (v.4.2.3) [Lines: 616-620]

```
    function safeTransferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public payable virtual override {
```

  

- ERC721A.sol (v.4.2.3) [Lines: 629-634]

```
    function safeTransferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes memory _data
    ) public payable virtual override {
```

  

While it keeps consistency with the original EIP-712 proposal, where the function `approve` is indeed marked as `payable`, the contract set under analysis does not seem to handle `ether` because the `mint` functionality relies on valid `merkle proofs` provided by users in order to perform the operation.

Given this information, we can conclude that users could send ETH (native tokens) to the contract mistakenly when interacting with the aforementioned functions. In this scenario, ETH would be locked permanently into the contract because neither `ERC721A.sol` nor `Collection.sol` contracts contain a `withdraw` method to move funds out of the contract.

##### Proof of Concept

After successfully minting the correct amount of tokens, by providing a valid `merkle proof`, the `owner` of the NFT is able to call the `approve` function in the ``ERC721A.sol`` contract, which is one of the four payable functions inherited by the `Collection.sol` contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

```
    function test_merkle_mint_and_approve_with_value() public {

        console.log(unicode"🔮", StdStyle.blue("test_merkle_mint\n\n"));

        /**
        1. set merkle proofs
         */

        bytes32[] memory morpheus_proof = new bytes32[](1);
        morpheus_proof[0] = 0x42069d1d9a5a0fbead4b4887d4bb3b204fa18c5cf54215bb92d5d12c143ffcf0;

        bytes32[] memory niobe_proof = new bytes32[](1);
        niobe_proof[0] = 0x7e585b6365b68eda89a77d89440802bf1191ef6075bd01e23d4d10d5b420a726;
        
        uint256 morpheus_quantity = 10;
        uint8 morpheus_index = 0;

        uint256 niobe_quantity = 20;
        uint8 niobe_index = 1;

        /**
        2. mint in Collection contract
         */
        
        // Morpheus mints with merkle proof
        vm.startPrank(morpheus);
        (bool success_mint, ) = address(collection).call{value: 0}(abi.encodeWithSelector(Collection.mint.selector, morpheus_quantity, morpheus_proof, morpheus_index));
        require(success_mint, "Call Reverted");

        // as NFT owner, Morpheus call approve
        (bool success_approve, ) = address(collection).call{value: 50_000 ether}(abi.encodeWithSelector(ERC721A.approve.selector, niobe, 0));
        require(success_approve, "Call Reverted");

    }
```

[AO:A/AC:L/AX:L/R:N/S:U/C:N/A:N/I:M/D:M/Y:N (6.3)](/bvss?q=AO:A/AC:L/AX:L/R:N/S:U/C:N/A:N/I:M/D:M/Y:N)

##### Recommendation

It is recommended to create a `withdraw` function with access control, allowing authorized parties and/or administrators to perform safe withdrawals from any remaining `ether` existent in the contract. For enhanced transparency, an event can also be emitted in these cases.

**Code example:**

**- Error declaration:**

```
    error ZeroBalance();
```

  

**- Event declaration:**

```
    event AdminWithdrawal(uint256 indexed amount, address indexed to);
```

  

**- Function declaration:**

```
    function withdraw(address _to) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 _amount = address(this).balance;
        if (_amount == 0) revert ZeroBalance();
        emit AdminWithdrawal(_amount, _to);
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require (success, "Collection: Failed to withdrawal");
    }
```

  

Additionally, it is not recommended to perform function overrides or custom modifications in the base `ERC721A.sol` contract, for example, requiring `msg.value == 0`, considering it heavily relies on low-level, assembly code blocks and any modification could introduce to bugs or vulnerabilities, if not thoroughly tested and validated.
