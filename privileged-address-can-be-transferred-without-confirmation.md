## Vulnerability Title

PRIVILEGED ADDRESS CAN BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT CONFIRMATION

### Overview


The report describes a bug in the contracts of a blockchain project that can lead to the owner of the contracts losing control of them. This is caused by a function called `update_config` being used incorrectly and allowing the owner to change the owner address without confirmation. The affected contracts are airdrop, bonding-v1, oracle, staking-v1, and vesting. The bug has been fixed in the latest commit. The impact of this bug is rated as 4 out of 5 and the likelihood of it occurring is 2 out of 5. The recommendation is to update to the latest commit to solve the issue.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description

An incorrect use of the `update_config` function in contracts can set owner to an invalid address and inadvertently lose control of the contracts, which cannot be undone in any way. Currently, the owner of the contracts can change **owner address** using the aforementioned function in a `single transaction` and `without confirmation` from the new address.

The affected smart contracts are the following:

* airdrop
* bonding-v1
* oracle
* staking-v1
* vesting
