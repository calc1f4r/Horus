## Vulnerability Title

Lack of the pair_id and token_id validation in the PixelswapStreamPool contract

### Overview


This report discusses a bug found in the PixelswapStreamPool contract, which allows users to manipulate the system and steal tokens from the settlement contract. The bug occurs when users send an OrderJettonNotification message from an arbitrary address, allowing them to execute a swap or add liquidity without transferring the required tokens. This can be exploited by sending a fake Jetton to the funding wallet and then using it in a PlaceOrder message to swap for tokens. The report recommends short-term and long-term solutions to validate user inputs and ensure the security of the system. After conducting a fix review, the team has determined that the issue has been resolved. 

### Original Finding Content

## Diﬃculty: High

## Type: Data Validation

## Target: contracts/pixelswap_streampool.tact

### Description
The `PlaceOrder` message receiver function of the `PixelswapStreamPool` contract does not validate that the `pair_id` specified in the message corresponds to the `token_id` values specified in the message. This allows users to provide arbitrary `token_id` values to execute a swap or add liquidity to a pair without transferring the required tokens.

The protocol allows users to transfer their Jettons and execute a protocol action in a single transaction by specifying order parameters in the `forward_payload` field of the transfer message of the Jetton contract. The Jetton contract sends the `OrderJettonNotification` message to the settlement contract, which adds a deposit to the user’s funding wallet, executes a swap, or adds liquidity to the specified pair based on the `forward_payload` value specified in the `OrderJettonNotification` message.

However, the `OrderJettonNotification` message receiver cannot verify that the message is sent by the correct Jetton wallet contract and is not sent by a malicious actor; it considers the sender as the `token_id` for the order to be executed. This allows users to add a funding wallet balance for an arbitrary `token_id`, execute a swap without transferring Jettons, and add liquidity to a pool without transferring Jettons by sending the `OrderJettonNotification` message from an arbitrary address.

[Redacted]

As a result, the `PlaceOrder` message receiver function of the `PixelswapStreamPool` contract does not check if the user-provided value of the `pair_id` field corresponds to the `token_id` values provided in the `PlaceOrder` message. This allows attackers to send the `OrderJettonNotification` message from an arbitrary address to steal tokens from the settlement contract.

### Exploit Scenario 1
Eve sends an `OrderJettonNotification` message from her smart wallet to swap USDC for TON from the TON/USDC pool. The order is executed successfully, and Eve gets free TON from the settlement contract.

### Exploit Scenario 2
Eve sends an `OrderJettonNotification` message from her smart wallet to deposit a fake Jetton to her funding wallet. She then sends a `PlaceOrder` message to swap USDC for TON by specifying the fake Jetton as input token `token_id` and TON/USDC pair `pair_id`. The order is executed successfully, and Eve gets free TON from the settlement contract.

### Recommendations
- **Short term:** Validate that the `pair_id` specified in the `PlaceOrder` message corresponds to the provided `token_id` values to ensure correct token transfers before executing an order.
- **Long term:** Validate all user inputs at all of the system’s entrypoints to ensure the correctness and security of the system.

### Fix Review Status
After conducting a fix review, the team determined that this issue has been resolved.
