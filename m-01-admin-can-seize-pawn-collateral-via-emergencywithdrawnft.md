## Vulnerability Title

[M-01] Admin Can Seize Pawn Collateral via `emergencyWithdrawNFT()`

### Overview


The report describes a bug in the `pawn()` function of the `PawnShop` contract. This function allows users to use their NFTs as collateral for a loan. However, the contract also has an `emergencyWithdrawNFT()` function that can be used by the admin to transfer any NFT held by the contract to an arbitrary address, even if the loan is still active. This means that the admin can steal user collateral and break the loan's lifecycle. The affected code can be found in the `Pawn.sol` file. The impact of this bug includes user collateral theft and protocol/loan state corruption. The report also provides a proof of concept and recommendations for fixing the bug, which the team has already addressed.

### Original Finding Content


## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `pawn(...)` flow escrows a user’s NFT inside `PawnShop` as collateral until the user repays via `redeem(...)` or the position is closed via `liquidate(...)` (context).

However, `PawnShop` also exposes an `emergencyWithdrawNFT(...)` function that lets `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` transfer _any_ NFT held by the contract to an arbitrary address, with no restriction that the loan is inactive and no state cleanup (problem).

This means an admin can directly steal user collateral (even for active loans) and can also permanently break the loan’s lifecycle because `redeem(...)`/`liquidate(...)` expect the contract to still own the NFT (impact).

## Location of Affected Code

File: [Pawn.sol](https://github.com/ShinyUrban/SmartContracts/blob/f49b5db73b297552666783ed587cf0818ef86b75/Pawn.sol)

```solidity
function emergencyWithdrawNFT(uint256 tokenId, address to) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    // @audit Can transfer active collateral to an arbitrary address
    if (to == address(0)) revert InvalidAddress();
    nftToken.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);
    emit EmergencyNFTWithdrawn(tokenId, to);
}
```

## Impact

- **User collateral theft**: An admin can move escrowed NFTs to themselves (or any address), bypassing borrower repayment rules.
- **Protocol/loan state corruption**: Once the NFT is moved out, `redeem(...)` cannot return collateral and `liquidate(...)` cannot burn it, leaving the `pawns[tokenId]` state effectively unresolvable.

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice calls `pawn(...)` and `PawnShop` escrows Alice’s NFT.
2. Admin calls `emergencyWithdrawNFT(tokenId, admin)`.
3. Alice can no longer redeem her NFT, and the protocol cannot liquidate it on-chain because the NFT is no longer owned by `PawnShop`.

## Recommendation

Consider applying the following changes:

- **Restrict scope**: Only allow emergency withdrawal for NFTs that are _not_ backing an active pawn:
  - Require `!pawns[tokenId].active`, or
  - Only allow withdrawal to `pawns[tokenId].borrower`.
- **Add safeguards**: Use a timelock + multisig for `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, and consider an on-chain guardian/emergency procedure that cannot seize active collateral.
- **Maintain invariants**: If a forced withdrawal is ever allowed, update or clear the pawn state in a way that preserves a consistent resolution path.

## Team Response

Fixed.
