## Vulnerability Title

[M-10] Contracts are vulnerable to fee-on-transfer accounting-related issues

### Overview


This bug report is about an issue in the code of the AxelarGateway.sol, InterchainTokenService.sol, and TokenManagerLockUnlockFee.sol contracts. There are four instances of this issue, which is related to the `transferFrom()` function used to move funds from the sender to the recipient. The issue is that the code does not verify if the received token amount matches the transferred amount, which could lead to balance inconsistencies when using fee-on-transfer tokens. An attacker might exploit leftover funds to gain unjustified credit.

The resolution proposed is to gauge the balance prior and post-transfer, and consider the differential as the transferred amount, instead of the predefined amount. The sponsor of the report agreed that there is a special token manager for such fee-on-transfer tokens, but the identified instances in the report are still affected by the issue. They consider the severity of the issue to be medium.

### Original Finding Content


*Note: this finding was reported via the winning [Automated Findings report](https://gist.github.com/thebrittfactor/c400e0012d0092316699c53843ecad41). It was declared out of scope for the audit, but is being included here for completeness.*

*There are 4 instances of this issue.*

### Resolution

The below-listed functions use `transferFrom()` to move funds from the sender to the recipient but fail to verify if the received token amount matches the transferred amount. This could pose an issue with fee-on-transfer tokens, where the post-transfer balance might be less than anticipated, leading to balance inconsistencies. There might be subsequent checks for a second transfer, but an attacker might exploit leftover funds (such as those accidentally sent by another user) to gain unjustified credit. A practical solution is to gauge the balance prior and post-transfer, and consider the differential as the transferred amount, instead of the predefined amount. 

Findings are labeled with `<= FOUND`.

> Invalid, we have a dedicated token manager for fee-on-transfer tokens that takes this into account. [Here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/token-manager/TokenManagerLockUnlockFee.sol) is TokenManagerLockUnlockFee for reference.

> Agree with the sponsor that there is a special token manager for such fee-on-transfer tokens. However, the identified instances in the report are still affected by the issue. Consequently, I consider Medium severity to be appropriate.
