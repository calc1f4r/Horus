## Vulnerability Title

Privileged Roles and Ownership

### Overview


The client has marked the issue as "Mitigated" and provided an explanation for how they are addressing it. The bug affects three files: `TokenVestingLinear.sol`, `TokenVestingSigmoid.sol`, and `PortalToken.sol`. The bug allows the owner of the contract to perform certain privileged operations, such as pausing the contract or updating the recipient wallet. The recommendation is to document these roles and follow best practices for key management to ensure security. 

### Original Finding Content

**Update**
Marked as "Mitigated" by the client. Addressed in: `df4791d0ab33c3c47ead2565e4b2f04a26ed0a0f`. The client provided the following explanation:

> We are mitigating this by:
> 
> 
> 1.   Renouncing ownership of some of the contracts
> 2.   Transferring ownerships to 3/4 multisig addresses
> 3.   Clearly documenting/communicating who owns what contract post deployment.

Considering the response of the client, we regard this issue as "Mitigated".

**File(s) affected:**`TokenVestingLinear.sol`, `TokenVestingSigmoid.sol`, `PortalToken.sol`

**Description:** Smart contracts inheriting OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract will have an `owner` variable to designate the address with special privileges to access specific functions of the contract. OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` contract also enables this capability, but uses a role-based system to distribute privileges.

These are the privileged operations identified during the audit:

In the contract `PortalToken`, the address with the role `owner` can:

*   Renounce his ownership via the function `renounceOwnership()`;
*   Transfer his ownership to any address via the function `transferOwnership()`;
*   Pause or unpause the contract via the function `pause()`, which will immediately disable or enable token transfers;
*   Enable or disable the permit feature via the function `disablePermit()`;
*   Update via the function `setProxyAddress()` the `proxy` address used to keep tokens bridged to other supported chains. The balance of this address is used to determine the current total supply of the token on this chain. As a result, updating this address will have a significant impact on the current total supply of the token;

In the contract `TokenVestingLinear`, the address with the role `owner` can:

*   Renounce his ownership via the function `renounceOwnership()`;
*   Transfer his ownership to any address via the function `transferOwnership()`;
*   Update the recipient wallet of any user with a valid schedule to any arbitrary address, via the function `adminUpdateRecepientWallet()`;
*   Update the `signerAddress` to any arbitrary address, via the function `setSignerAddress()`;
*   Set the address of the token supported by the contract via the function `updateTokenAddress()`, if not already done;

In the contract `TokenVestingLinear`, the address with the role `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can:

*   Renounce his role via the function `renounceRole()`;
*   Grant this role to another address via the function `grantRole()`;
*   Revoke this role from another address via the function `revokeRole()`;
*   Set the address of the token supported by the contract via the function `setToken()`, if not already done; In the contract `TokenVestingLinear`, the address with the role `SCHEDULE_ADDER_ROLE` can:
*   Renounce his role via the function `renounceRole()`;
*   Add a schedule to a given `recipient` for a given allocation `value`, following a sigmoid curve defined by the parameter `p0` that will release an amount of `50%` in `tHalfFromNow` seconds.

**Recommendation:** These roles and the associated privileges should be documented to users. Also, key management should follow the latest best practices in security.
