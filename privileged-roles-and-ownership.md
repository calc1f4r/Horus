## Vulnerability Title

Privileged Roles and Ownership

### Overview


The Blex team has acknowledged an issue with certain contracts in the protocol that have privileged roles, which could pose a risk to end-users. They have decided not to modify the current version but will consider refactoring in future versions to reduce centralization. It is recommended to update the user-facing documentation to clearly explain all privileged roles in the current version. The affected files include `Ac.sol`, `AcUpgradable.sol`, `RewardDistributor.sol`, `PositionStore.sol`, `PositionBook.sol`, `OrderStore.sol`, `OrderBook.sol`, `ChainPriceFeed.sol`, `FastPriceFeed.sol`, `Price.sol`, `FeeVault.sol`, `FundFee.sol`, `FeeRouter.sol`, `CoreVault.sol`, `VaultRouter.sol`, and `VaultReward.sol`. These contracts have various privileged roles that can potentially break the system, allow permissioned execution, cause distorted execution, or result in loss of funds. It is recommended to adhere to best practices by removing unnecessary roles and ensuring proper protection for functions that can be called by privileged roles. The report provides a detailed list of roles and their corresponding functions for each contract. 

### Original Finding Content

**Update**
The Blex team acknowledged the issue but will not modify the current version. They will consider refactoring in future versions to reduce centralization.

We recommend updating the user-facing documentation to make all privileged roles clear for the current version.

**File(s) affected:**`./contracts/ac/Ac.sol`, `./contracts/ac/AcUpgradable.sol`, `./contracts/vault/RewardDistributor.sol`, `./contracts/position/PositionStore.sol`, `./contracts/position/PositionBook.sol`, `./contracts/order/OrderStore.sol`, `./contracts/order/OrderBook.sol`, `./contracts/oracle/ChainPriceFeed.sol`, `./contracts/oracle/FastPriceFeed.sol`, `./contracts/oracle/Price.sol`, `./contracts/fee/FeeVault.sol`, `./contracts/fee/FundFee.sol`, `./contracts/fee/FeeRouter.sol`, `./contracts/vault/CoreVault.sol`, `./contracts/vault/VaultRouter.sol`, `./contracts/vault/VaultReward.sol`, `./contracts/market/GlobalValid.sol`, `./contracts/market/MarketValid.sol`, `./contracts/market/MarketRouter.sol`, `./contracts/market/Market.sol`, `./contracts/market/MarketFactory.sol`

**Description:** Certain contracts have state variables, e.g. `owner`, which provide certain addresses with privileged roles. Such roles may pose a risk to end-users.

**This project contains several roles on every level of the protocol with direct access to all protocol parameters, allowing privileged roles to accidentally or with malicious intent to:**

1.   Break the system (denial of service).
2.   Permissioned execution (Allow certain trades, but not others).
3.   Distorted execution (Distorted oracles or other system parameters) leading to unfavorable trades.
4.   Loss of funds (Transfer of some or all funds to arbitrary addresses).

For a detailed list of roles per contract see the following list:

The `AcUpgradable.sol` contract contains the following privileged roles:

1.   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, as initialized during the execution of `_initialize()` to `msg.sender`:
    1.   Renounce the role (**and thereby prevent any future calls to the following listed functions!**) by calling `revokeRole()` on oneself.
    2.   Assign a new `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` address by calling `transferAdmin()`.
    3.   Grant/Revoke arbitrary roles (`ROLE_CONTROLLER`, `MANAGER_ROLE`, `ROLE_POS_KEEPER`, …) to/from addresses by caling `grantRole()`/`revokeRole()`.

2.   `_owner`, as initialized during the execution of `_initialize()` to `msg.sender`:
    1.   Rennounce the role (**and thereby prevent any future calls to the following listed functions!**) by calling `renounceOwnership()`.
    2.   Assign a new `_owner` address by calling `transferOwnership()`.

    *   **No other actions! This role and the inheritance of `Ownable` is therefore unnecessary (see "Adherence to Best Practices" point 1.).**

The `Ac.sol` contract contains the following privileged roles:

1.   `_owner`, as initialized during the execution of `constructor()` to `msg.sender`:
    1.   Rennounce the role (**and thereby prevent any future calls to the following listed functions!**) by calling `renounceOwnership()`.
    2.   Assign a new `_owner` address by calling `transferOwnership()`.
    3.   **No other actions! This role and the inheritance of `Ownable` is therefore unnecessary (see "Adherence to Best Practices" point 1.).**

1.   `MANAGER_ROLE`, as initialized/set through `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` by calling `grantRole()`:
    1.   **Withdraw an arbitrary amount of any token from the contract to an arbitrary address by calling `withdrawToken()`.**

3.   `rewardTracker`, as initialized during the execution of `initialize()` to parameter `_rewardTracker`:
    1.   Transfer any pending reward tokens to oneself and update the last distribution time by calling `distribute()`.

1.   `ROLE_CONTROLLER` (`onlyController`-modifier), as initialized during the constructor execution to `msg.sender`:
    1.   Overwrite the global and an accounts position data by calling `set()`.
    2.   Overwrite the global position and remove an accounts position by calling `remove()`.

2.   `MANAGER_ROLE` (`onlyAdmin`-modifier), as initialized/set through `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` by calling `grantRole()`:
    1.   Change the position book contract address (`positionBook`) and grant it the `ROLE_CONTROLLER` role by calling `setPositionBook()`. **Note: Functions `set()` and `remove()` can be called by any address that holds the `ROLE_CONTROLLER` role, which can be granted independently via `grantRole()`, without the need of calling `setPositionBook()`!**

The `PositionBook.sol` contract inherits from contract `Ac.sol`, therefore contains all its privileged roles and functionailities and additionally:

1.   `ROLE_CONTROLLER` (`onlyController`-modifier), as initialized during the initializer execution to parameter `marketAddr`:

    4.   Increment the account-specific order ID by calling `generateID()`.

The `OrderBook.sol` contract inherits from contract `Ac.sol`, therefore contains all its privileged roles and functionailities and additionally:

    2.   Update certain order fields (`price`, `triggerAbove`, take profit and stop loss) by calling `update()`.
    3.   Delete all orders of a given account by calling `removeByAccount()`.
    4.   Remove a given order (and potentially its corresponding order pair, if it was a close-position) by calling `remove()`.

The `ChainPriceFeed.sol` contract inherits from contract `Ac.sol`, therefore contains all its privileged roles and functionailities and additionally:

1.   `MANAGER_ROLE` (`onlyAdmin`-modifier), as initialized during the constructor execution to `msg.sender`:
    1.   Change the price sample size (default: `3`) by calling `setSampleSpace()`.

    2.   Enable/Disable converting positions and orders by calling `setIsEnableMarketConvertToOrder()`.
    3.   Add/Remove market addresses by calling `addMarket()`/`removeMarket()`.

The `Market.sol` contract inherits from contract `Ac.sol`, therefore contains all its privileged roles and functionailities and additionally:

1.   `ROLE_CONTROLLER` (`onlyController`-modifier), as set via `grantRole()` by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`:
    1.   Increase/Decrease arbitrary positions by calling `increasePositionWithOrders()`/`decreasePosition()`.
    2.   Call any function of the order manager contract (`orderMgr`) in the context of the market storage (`delegatecall`) by calling `fallback()`.

    1.   Set the order book, position book, market valid, position manager and order manager contract addresses by calling:

    1.   Remove addresses from the `markets` array by calling `remove()`.

Having such a complex role system with such powerful abilities, increases the chance of compromised private keys, which in turn could lead to a denial of service and/or loss of funds of the protocol.

**Recommendation:** This centralization of power needs to be made clear to the users, especially depending on the level of privilege the contract allows to the owner.
