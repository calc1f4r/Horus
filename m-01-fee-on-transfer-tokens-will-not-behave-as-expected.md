## Vulnerability Title

[M-01] Fee on transfer tokens will not behave as expected

### Overview


The bug report is about a vulnerability in the Numoen protocol which allows users to borrow tokens. The vulnerability is that if a fee on transfer token is entailed, it will cause the mint() function in Lendgine.sol to revert when checking if balanceAfter < balanceBefore + collateral. This is due to the fact that the balance after the transfer of the token1 (collateral) is lower than the balance before the transfer, due to the fee factor. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to either whitelist token0 and token1 to ensure no fee-on-transfer token is allowed when a new instance of a market is created using the factory, or to calculate the balance before and after the transfer of token1 (collateral) and use the difference between those two balances as the amount received rather than using the input amount 'collateral' if deflationary token is going to be allowed in the protocol.

### Original Finding Content


In Numoen, it does not specifically restrict the type of ERC20 collateral used for borrowing.

If fee on transfer token(s) is/are entailed, it will specifically make `mint()` revert in Lendgine.sol when checking if `balanceAfter < balanceBefore + collateral`.

### Proof of Concept

[File: Lendgine.sol#L71-L102](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-numoen/blob/main/src/core/Lendgine.sol#L71-L102)

```solidity
  function mint(
    address to,
    uint256 collateral,
    bytes calldata data
  )
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 shares)
  {
    _accrueInterest();

    uint256 liquidity = convertCollateralToLiquidity(collateral);
    shares = convertLiquidityToShare(liquidity);

    if (collateral == 0 || liquidity == 0 || shares == 0) revert InputError();
    if (liquidity > totalLiquidity) revert CompleteUtilizationError();
    // next check is for the case when liquidity is borrowed but then was completely accrued
    if (totalSupply > 0 && totalLiquidityBorrowed == 0) revert CompleteUtilizationError();

    totalLiquidityBorrowed += liquidity;
    (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = burn(to, liquidity);
    _mint(to, shares);

    uint256 balanceBefore = Balance.balance(token1);
    IMintCallback(msg.sender).mintCallback(collateral, amount0, amount1, liquidity, data);
    uint256 balanceAfter = Balance.balance(token1);

99:    if (balanceAfter < balanceBefore + collateral) revert InsufficientInputError();

    emit Mint(msg.sender, collateral, shares, liquidity, to);
  }
```

As can be seen from the code block above, line 99 is meant to be reverting when `balanceAfter < balanceBefore + collateral`. So in the case of deflationary tokens, the error is going to be thrown even though the token amount has been received due to the fee factor.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider:

1.  whitelisting token0 and token1 ensuring no fee-on-transfer token is allowed when a new instance of a market is created using the factory, or
2.  calculating the balance before and after the transfer of token1 (collateral), and use the difference between those two balances as the amount received rather than using the input amount `collateral` if deflationary token is going to be allowed in the protocol.

 > This finding and its duplicates show a valid issue that prevents the use of rebase/FoT tokens with the protocol. As there is no clear mention of the support of non-standard ERC-20 tokens in the Numoen docs or contest README, I consider Medium the appropriate severity.

 > How is this different from https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L486-L490? If it isn't any different, which I don't think it is, then we will just acknowledge this and be mindful of which token we allow people to list. 

**[berndartmueller (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-numoen-findings/issues/263#issuecomment-1448419805):**
 > @kyscott18 - In this specific case of the `mint(..)` function, there is no difference to Uniswap. Both implementations do not work properly for this kind of rebase/FoT tokens. Uniswap V3 is built on a setup of assumptions ([see here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/de9702518fdb3f749eb417e526b08a3167c9e6b6/bug-bounty.md#assumptions)), excluding rebase tokens.

> It becomes a bigger issue if the use of rebase tokens can influence the token balance accounting of other regular ERC-20 token pairs, which is not the case for Numoen.

> One of the other submissions presents further instances in the code which are potentially affected by incorrect token balance accounting caused by rebase/FoT token -> [issue 272](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-numoen-findings/issues/272)

 > Okay, thanks for clarifying. I think we should mark this as noted by the team because we want to use the same assumptions as uniswap in this case.
