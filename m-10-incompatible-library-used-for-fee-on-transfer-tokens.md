## Vulnerability Title

M-10: incompatible library used for Fee on Transfer tokens

### Overview


This bug report discusses an issue with the Ammplify protocol, which is currently being used for a competition. The issue was found by several people and has been acknowledged by the team, but they will not be fixing it at this time.

The problem is related to the protocol's use of the RFT library, which is incompatible with tokens that have a fee on transfer. This is a problem because the competition details explicitly state that these types of tokens are expected to work correctly with the protocol.

The root cause of the issue is that the RFT library has a strict validation check that does not support fee on transfer tokens. This means that when the protocol tries to transfer these tokens, it will always fail and revert the transaction.

To exploit this issue, a user would need to attempt creating a position with a fee-on-transfer token. This would trigger the protocol to transfer the tokens through the RFT library, which would then fail due to the fee deduction. This results in a denial of service for any token with a fee on transfer, which is a medium severity issue according to the Sherlock validity criteria.

To mitigate this issue, the team could either implement proper fee-on-transfer token handling in the settlement system or use a different library. Alternatively, they could simply not allow fee on transfer tokens in the protocol.

### Summary

From the competition details:
>However, we are not expected to have issues with:
...
Transfer of less than amount
...
The traits listed above are in scope and the contracts are expected to work correctly with them.

However, the protocol adopts the `RFT` library which is incompatible with tokens that have a fee on transfer.


### Root Cause

The competition details explicitly states that "Transfer of less than amount" tokens are expected to work correctly but the protocol handles token transfers through an external library, [RFTLib](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-09-ammplify/blob/main/Ammplify/src/facets/Maker.sol#L49), for all its operations.

The issue is this library does not support Fee on Transfer tokens as their is a strict validation check within it:
```solidity
        actualDeltas = new int256[](tokens.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; ++i) {
            address token = tokens[i];

            // Validate our balances.
            uint256 finalBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            actualDeltas[i] = U256Ops.sub(finalBalance, startBalances[i]);
            if (actualDeltas[i] < balanceChanges[i]) {
                revert InsufficientReceive(token, balanceChanges[i], actualDeltas[i]);
            }
```

When the library tries to transfer the tokens, the actual deltas will always be less than `balanceChanges` therefore the protocol will always revert for any fee on transfer token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to attempt creating a position with a fee-on-transfer token

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User holds fee-on-transfer tokens that the protocol explicitly claims to support.
2. User attempts to create a maker position by calling `newMaker()` or similar functions
3. Protocol attempts to transfer tokens through `RFTLib.settle()`
4. Fee-on-transfer token deducts transfer fee e.g. 2% of transfer amount
5. Protocol receives less tokens than expected due to fee deduction
6. RFTLib validation fails with `InsufficientReceive` error, reverting the transaction
7. User cannot create any positions with fee-on-transfer tokens despite protocol's compatibility claims

### Impact

Denial of service for any token that has a fee on transfer, a capability that should be possible based on the competition details.

DoS is medium severity according to Sherlock validity criterua

### PoC

- Sufficient evidence given in Root cause, PoC can be provided upon request.

### Mitigation

Implement proper fee-on-transfer token handling in the settlement system or use a different library.

alternatively, do not allow fee on transfer tokens in the protocol.
