## Vulnerability Title

[H-09] BathPair.sol#rebalancePair() can be front run to steal the pending rebalancing amount

### Overview


This bug report concerns the BathToken contract, which is part of the 2022-05-rubicon project. The vulnerability occurs when the strategist calls the rebalancePair() function, which can lead to a theft of the pending yields. A proof of concept is given to demonstrate how the attack works. 

The underlyingBalance() function in the BathToken contract returns the balance of the underlying token, plus the outstandingAmount. The outstandingAmount is the amount of the underlying token that has been filled to the contract and is awaiting rebalancing by the strategist. The rebalancePair() function will cause a surge in the price per share of the BathToken, as it will transfer a certain amount of the underlying token into the contract. 

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by front running the strategist's rebalancePair() transaction. They can deposit a large amount of the underlying token, take a large share of the pool, and withdraw right after the rebalancePair() transaction for an instant profit. 

The bug report recommends adding a new variable to track the rebalancingAmount on the BathToken, and for the BathToken to be notified of any pending rebalancing amount changes via the BathPair. The rebalancingAmount should also be considered as part of the underlyingBalance().

```solidity

    uint256 _pool = IERC20(underlyingToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    return _pool.add(outstandingAmount);
}
```

```solidity
function removeFilledTradeAmount(uint256 amt) external onlyPair {
    outstandingAmount = outstandingAmount.sub(amt);
    emit LogRemoveFilledTradeAmount(
        IERC20(underlyingToken),
        amt,
        underlyingBalance(),
        outstandingAmount,
        totalSupply
    );
}
```

For `BathToken`, there will be non-underlyingToken assets sitting on the contract that have filled to the contract and are awaiting rebalancing by strategists.

We assume the rebalance will happen periodically, between one rebalance to the next rebalance, `underlyingBalance()` will decrease over time as the orders get filled, so that the price per share will get lower while the actual equity remain relatively stable. This kind of price deviation will later be corrected by rebalancing.

Every time a `BathPair.sol#rebalancePair()` get called, there will be a surge of price per share for the `BathToken`, as a certain amount of `underlyingToken` will be transferred into the contract. 

This enables a well known attack vector, which allows the pending yields to be stolen by front run the strategist's `BathPair.sol#rebalancePair()` transaction, deposit and take a large share of the vault, and `withdraw()` right after the `rebalancePair()` transaction for instant profit.

### PoC

Given:

- Current `underlyingBalance()` is `100,000 USDC`;
- Pending rebalancing amount is `1000 USDC`;

1. `strategist` calls `rebalancePair()`;
2. The attacker sends a deposit tx with a higher gas price to deposit `100,000 USDC`, take 50% share of the pool;
3. After the transaction in step 1 is mined, the attacker calls `withdraw()` and retireve `100,500 USDC`.

As a result, the attacker has stolen half of the pending yields in about 1 block of time.

### Recommendation

Consider adding a new variable to track rebalancingAmount on `BathToken`.

`BathToken` should be notified for any pending rebalancing amount changes via `BathPair` in order to avoid sudden surge of pricePerShare over `rebalancePair()`.

`rebalancingAmount` should be considered as part of `underlyingBalance()`.
