## Vulnerability Title

[M-05] Supporting fee-on-transfer tokens can lead to bad debt

### Overview


The report discusses a problem with the protocol's support for fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens. These tokens are rare and can cause high levels of bad debt within the system. The issue is that changing the liquidation and collateral factors will not be enough to resolve the problem. This can be seen through a simple example where a user deposits 100,000 FOT tokens, but the contract only receives 99,000 tokens and credits the user with the full 100,000. When the user withdraws 99,000 tokens, they actually receive 89,100 after fees, but the contract still thinks it holds 1000 tokens. This allows the user to create bad debt positions at a low cost, which can harm the system. The report recommends not supporting FOT tokens at all, as the protocol does not have the necessary post-transfer accounting logic to handle them effectively. 

### Original Finding Content

**Severity**

**Impact**: High, FOT tokens will incur bad debt

**Likelihood**: Low, FOT tokens are rare

**Description**

The protocol claims it can support fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens if necessary. According to the pre-audit questionlist,

```
- The Accounts will indeed be overvalued, since we store the ‘amount transferred’ (which would be higher than the amount received on the account) to calculate the value of the Account.
- If enabled, the collateral and liquidation factors (haircut on the value) will be adjusted to accommodate for the value loss due to fees.
```

The issue is that changing the liquidation and collateral factors will not be enough to resolve the issue. This can be explained by a simple example.

Say Token A is a FOT token, with a 1% fee.

1. Alice deposits 100,000 tokens of token A.
2. Contract receives 99,000 tokens, but credits Alice's account with the full 100,000 tokens
3. Alice now withdraws 99,000 tokens
4. Alice receives 89100 tokens after fees. Contract has 0 tokens, since it paid out all its holdings, but contract still thinks that it holds (100,000 - 99,000)=1000 tokens.
5. Alice can now take out a loan against those 1000 tokens which the contract thinks it holds. This is entirely bad debt.

With deposits and successive withdrawals, FOT tokens can be used to create bad debt positions at very minimal costs. Since this directly affects the health of the system, this is a problem.

**Recommendations**

FOT tokens should always be used with post-transfer accounting logic. Since the protocol doesn't have that, it is recommended not to support FOT tokens at all, despite the claim in the Questionlist.
