## Vulnerability Title

Block Proposer DDoS

### Overview


This bug report is about the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain, which is a decentralized network where a "block proposer" is responsible for selecting a set of transactions to include in the block that each satisfies the beacon chain's state transition function. The report states that malicious actors can use deanonymization attacks to determine the IP address of the block proposer, allowing them to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the proposer. This attack can be used to prevent validators from fulfilling their responsibilities, such as slot attestations or block proposals. 

The report states that the only known short-term mitigation is to configure validators with a “front-end/”back-end” network topology, which would require the validator and each beacon chain node to be deployed to separate servers. The report also mentions other potential mitigations, such as using a sacrificial reverse proxy for attestation gossip or deploying an L3 firewall in front of the validator, but due to time constraints, the eﬀectiveness of such mitigations could not be verified.

The report recommends that the Ethereum Foundation should pursue secret leader elections for inclusion in a future hard fork as a long-term solution. This would help to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the system and stealing a proportion of the validator awards.

### Original Finding Content

## Diﬃculty: High

## Type: Data Validation

## Description
The Ethereum 2.0 Specification defines a “block proposer” for each beacon chain slot [1]. Block proposers are responsible for selecting a set of transactions to include in the block that each satisfies the beacon chain’s state transition function. When validators successfully propose a valid block, they are rewarded an amount of ETH that constitutes a large percentage of validator staking rewards. The block proposers for a given slot in an epoch can be pre-calculated up to one epoch ahead of time.

The IP address of a given validator (and thus, the IP of a block proposer) can be determined by any P2P actor using previously published deanonymization attacks [2]. Given that the identity of block proposers is known ahead of time, and that a block proposer’s IP address may be ascertained by a malicious actor, block proposers may be subject to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with the goal of forcing the block proposer to miss their proposal slot. 

This attack can be extended to prevent validators from fulfilling other validator responsibilities, such as slot attestations. But preventing block proposals is more likely as it may have a financial incentive, as demonstrated in the exploit scenario below. This attack is not unique to Prysm, and is present in all Ethereum 2.0 consensus clients at the time of writing.

## Exploit Scenario
Attacker Alice and victim Bob operate Ethereum validators. In the upcoming epoch, Bob is assigned to propose a block in slot 1, and Alice is assigned to propose a block in slot 2. While waiting for Bob to propose a block, Alice notices a transaction on the gossip layer that pays an extraordinarily high priority fee, and that this transaction will likely be included in Bob’s block.

Alice then launches a DDoS attack against Bob’s validator in order to knock it offline so it will miss its proposal slot. Bob’s validator misses its proposal slot, and Alice includes the high-value transaction in her proposed block for slot 2. Through this attack, Alice effectively steals a proportion of the validator awards that were designated for Bob’s slot.

## Recommendation
Short term, the only known mitigation is to configure validators with a “front-end/back-end” network topology [3]. In this topology, each validator client (back end) routes its block proposals and attestations to one of two beacon chain nodes (front end). Using this mitigation, an attack against a block proposer will take down the attestation beacon chain node (as that is the IP address that can be revealed using current research), and the block proposal node is free to relay the proposed block to the rest of the network.

It should be noted that this mitigation would require the validator and each beacon chain node to be deployed to separate servers, which complicates deployment and violates the current recommendation to run all the validation software on a single machine. There may be other mitigations, such as using a sacrificial reverse proxy for attestation gossip or deploying an L3 firewall in front of the validator. However, due to time constraints, we could not verify the effectiveness of such mitigations.

Long term, the Ethereum Foundation should pursue secret leader elections for inclusion in a future hard fork.
