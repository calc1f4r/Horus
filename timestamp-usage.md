## Vulnerability Title

Timestamp usage

### Overview


This bug report concerns the use of timestamps and `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) for contract logic in the GNTAllocation contract. It is recommended to use `block.number` instead, as miners can manipulate the timestamps. While the risk of this is low, and the potential damage limited, it is still advised to switch to `block.number` if necessary. The Token.sol file is correctly using `block.number`. For more information, there is a link to a Stack Exchange question on the topic.

### Original Finding Content

There’s a problem with using timestamps and `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) for contract logic, based on the fact that miners can perform some manipulation. In general, [it’s better not to rely on timestamps for contract logic](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#timestamp-dependence). The solutions is to use `block.number` instead, and approximate dates with expected block heights and time periods with expected block amounts.


The GNTAllocation contract uses timestamps at [several](https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-crowdfunding/blob/50100b27a7c6841ed430a028d100f5d45ba08fb1/contracts/GNTAllocation.sol#L22) [points](https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-crowdfunding/blob/50100b27a7c6841ed430a028d100f5d45ba08fb1/contracts/GNTAllocation.sol#L56). The risk of miner manipulation, though, is really low. The potential damage is also limited: miners could only slightly manipulate the developer lock period duration. We recommend the team to consider the potential risk and switch to `block.number` if necessary.


For more info on this topic, see [this stack exchange question](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/413/can-a-contract-safely-rely-on-block-timestamp).


`block.number` is correctly used in the Token.sol file.
