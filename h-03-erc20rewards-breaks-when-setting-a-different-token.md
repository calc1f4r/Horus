## Vulnerability Title

[H-03] ERC20Rewards breaks when setting a different token

### Overview


The bug report is about a vulnerability in the `setRewards` function which allows setting a different token. This could lead to issues when the new token is more (less) valuable, or uses different decimals. For example, if one receives 1.0 DAI (with 18 decimals) in the first reward period and waits until the new period starts with USDC (using only 6 decimals) to claim their reward, they would receive 1e12 USDC, which is one trillion USD. This could lead to users losing out if they claim too late/early.

The recommended mitigation steps are to either disallow changing the reward token or clear user's pending rewards of the old token. The second approach requires more code changes and keeping track of what token a user last claimed.

## Vulnerability details

The `setRewards` function allows setting a different token.
Holders of a previous reward period cannot all be paid out and will receive **their old reward amount** in the new token.

This leads to issues when the new token is more (less) valuable, or uses different decimals.

**Example:** Assume the first reward period paid out in `DAI` which has 18 decimals. Someone would have received `1.0 DAI = 1e18 DAI` if they called `claim` now. Instead, they wait until the new period starts with `USDC` (using only 6 decimals) and can `claim` their `1e18` reward amount in USDC which would equal `1e12 USDC`, one trillion USD.

## Impact
Changing the reward token only works if old and new tokens use the same decimals and have the exact same value. Otherwise, users that claim too late/early will lose out.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Disallow changing the reward token, or clear user's pending rewards of the old token. The second approach requires more code changes and keeping track of what token a user last claimed.
