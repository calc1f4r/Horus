## Vulnerability Title

Using fee-on-transfer tokens to fund distribution proposals creates under-funded proposals which causes claiming rewards to revert

### Overview


This bug report is about `DistributionProposal::execute()` [L67](https://github.com/dexe-network/DeXe-Protocol/tree/f2fe12eeac0c4c63ac39670912640dc91d94bda5/contracts/gov/proposals/DistributionProposal.sol#L67) not accounting for Fee-On-Transfer tokens. This means that users are unable to claim their rewards as the distribution proposal will be under-funded. A proof of concept was provided to demonstrate the issue.

The recommended mitigation for this issue is to either not support fee-on-transfer tokens or if they are to be supported, `DistributionProposal::execute()` should check the contract's current erc20 balance for the reward token, transfer in the erc20 tokens, and calculate actual change in the contract's balance for the reward token and set that as the reward amount. It was also recommended that comprehensive unit and integration tests be added to exercise all functionality of the system using Fee-On-Transfer tokens.

In response, DeXe has decided not to support fee-on-transfer tokens throughout the system as it would result in bad user experience and huge commissions for the end users.

### Original Finding Content

**Description:** `DistributionProposal::execute()` [L67](https://github.com/dexe-network/DeXe-Protocol/tree/f2fe12eeac0c4c63ac39670912640dc91d94bda5/contracts/gov/proposals/DistributionProposal.sol#L67) doesn't account for Fee-On-Transfer tokens but sets `proposal.rewardAmount` to the input `amount` parameter.

**Impact:** Users can't claim their rewards as `DistributionProposal::claim()` will revert since the distribution proposal will be under-funded as the fee-on-transfer token transferred `amount-fee` tokens into the `DistributionProposal` contract.

**Proof of Concept:** First add a new file `mock/tokens/ERC20MockFeeOnTransfer.sol`:

        emit Transfer(src, address(0), fee);

        return true;
    }
}
```

Then change  `test/gov/proposals/DistributionProposal.test.js` to:

* add new line L24 `const ERC20MockFeeOnTransfer = artifacts.require("ERC20MockFeeOnTransfer");`
* add new line L51 `ERC20MockFeeOnTransfer.numberFormat = "BigNumber";`
* Add this PoC under the section `describe("claim()", () => {`:
```javascript
      it("using fee-on-transfer tokens to fund distribution proposals prevents claiming rewards", async () => {
        // create fee-on-transfer token with 1 wei transfer fee
        // this token also doesn't implement approvals so don't need to worry about that
        let feeOnTransferToken
          = await ERC20MockFeeOnTransfer.new("MockFeeOnTransfer", "MockFeeOnTransfer", 18, wei("1"));

        // mint reward tokens to sending address
        await feeOnTransferToken.mint(govPool.address, wei("10"));

        // use GovPool to create a proposal with 10 wei reward
        await govPool.createProposal(
          "example.com",
          [
            [feeOnTransferToken.address, 0, getBytesApprove(dp.address, wei("10"))],
            [dp.address, 0, getBytesDistributionProposal(1, feeOnTransferToken.address, wei("10"))],
          ],
          [],
          { from: SECOND }
        );

        // attempt to fully fund the proposal using the fee-on-transfer reward token
        await impersonate(govPool.address);
        await dp.execute(1, feeOnTransferToken.address, wei("10"), { from: govPool.address });

        // only 1 vote so SECOND should get the entire 10 wei reward
        await govPool.vote(1, true, 0, [1], { from: SECOND });

        // attempting to claim the reward fails as the proposal is under-funded
        // due to the fee-on-transfer token transferring less into the DistributionProposal
        // contract than the inputted amount
        await truffleAssert.reverts(dp.claim(SECOND, [1]), "Gov: insufficient funds");
      });
```

Run with `npx hardhat test --grep "fee-on-transfer"`

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider one of the two options:

1. Don't support the fee-on-transfer tokens for the current version. Mention clearly on the website, official documentation that such tokens should not be used by DAO pools, both as governance tokens or sale tokens.

2. If fee-on-transfer tokens are to be supported, `DistributionProposal::execute()` should:
* check the contract's current erc20 balance for the reward token,
* transfer in the erc20 tokens,
* calculate actual change in the contract's balance for the reward token and set that as the reward amount.

Other places that may require similar fixes to support Fee-On-Transfer tokens:
* `TokenSaleProposalWhitelist::lockParticipationTokens()`
* `GovUserKeeper::depositTokens()`
* `GovPool::delegateTreasury()`

Recommend the project add comprehensive unit & integration tests exercising all functionality of the system using Fee-On-Transfer tokens. Also recommend project consider whether it wants to support Rebasing tokens and implement similar unit tests for Rebasing tokens. If the project no longer wishes to support Fee-On-Transfer tokens this should be made clear to users.

**Dexe:**
We will not support fee-on-transfer tokens throughout the system. There are many internal transfers of tokens between contracts during the flow; supporting fee-on-transfer tokens will result in bad UX and huge commissions for the end users.
