## Vulnerability Title

Rewards can be lost

### Overview


This bug report is about a problem with rewards being lost in the MixBytes Lido project. The issue is that if certain addresses have been set to 0, then the rewards can be lost. The addresses affected are listed in the report. The recommendation is to add a zero address check. This means that the code should be checked to make sure that the addresses are not set to 0, which would prevent the rewards from being lost.
