## Vulnerability Title

[M-04] ERC4626 does not work with fee-on-transfer tokens

### Overview


This bug report deals with the issue of incorrect minting of shares in the ERC4626.sol file. Specifically, the `deposit/mint` functions do not work well with fee-on-transfer tokens as the `amount` variable is the pre-fee amount, including the fee, whereas the `totalAssets` do not include the fee anymore. This can be exploited to mint more shares than desired. 

To demonstrate, a `deposit(1000)` should result in the same shares as two deposits of `deposit(500)` but it does not because `amount` is the pre-fee amount. Assume a fee-on-transfer of `20%`. Assume current `totalAmount = 1000`, `totalShares = 1000` for simplicity. The two deposits lead to `35` more shares than a single deposit of the sum of the deposits.

The bug report outlines the recommended mitigation steps to address the issue. The `amount` should be the amount excluding the fee, i.e., the amount the contract actually received. This can be done by subtracting the pre-contract balance from the post-contract balance. However, this would create another issue with ERC777 tokens. Another potential solution is to overwrite `previewDeposit` to predict the post-fee `amount` and do the shares computation on that.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by cmichel_

> The docs/video say `ERC4626.sol` is in scope as its part of `TurboSafe`

The `ERC4626.deposit/mint` functions do not work well with fee-on-transfer tokens as the `amount` variable is the pre-fee amount, including the fee, whereas the `totalAssets` do not include the fee anymore.

This can be abused to mint more shares than desired.

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount, address to) public virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewDeposit.
    require((shares = previewDeposit(amount)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");

    // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    _mint(to, shares);

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, to, amount, shares);

    afterDeposit(amount, shares);
}
```

### Proof of Concept

A `deposit(1000)` should result in the same shares as two deposits of `deposit(500)` but it does not because `amount` is the pre-fee amount.
Assume a fee-on-transfer of `20%`. Assume current `totalAmount = 1000`, `totalShares = 1000` for simplicity.

*   `deposit(1000) = 1000 / totalAmount * totalShares = 1000 shares`
*   `deposit(500) = 500 / totalAmount * totalShares = 500 shares`. Now the `totalShares` increased by 500 but the `totalAssets` only increased by `(100% - 20%) * 500 = 400`. Therefore, the second `deposit(500) = 500 / (totalAmount + 400) * (newTotalShares) = 500 / (1400) * 1500 = 535.714285714 shares`.

In total, the two deposits lead to `35` more shares than a single deposit of the sum of the deposits.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`amount` should be the amount excluding the fee, i.e., the amount the contract actually received.
This can be done by subtracting the pre-contract balance from the post-contract balance.
However, this would create another issue with ERC777 tokens.

Maybe `previewDeposit` should be overwritten by vaults supporting fee-on-transfer tokens to predict the post-fee `amount`. And do the shares computation on that, but then the `afterDeposit` is still called with the original `amount` and implementers need to be aware of this.

 > This is intended. Fee-on-transfer functions can be implemented in another base contract. This contract is only one implementation of the [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626).

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-tribe-turbo-findings/issues/26#issuecomment-1073036352):**
 > Given no context, I would side with the sponsor as the ERC4626 standard is meant to work with ERC20 Standard tokens.
> 
> However, in bringing the ERC4626 mixin into scope, the sponsor's code has an explicit mention of ERC777 which does open up to the possibility of having fees on transfer.
> 
> Because ultimately the warden didn't stretch the scope (as that happened because of the mixin), and the warden showed a way to provide leakage of value or denial of service exclusively if the mixin code is used in conjunction with a `feeOnTransfer` token.
> 
> Given that the mixin code comments explicitly mention attempting to support non-standard tokens.
> 
> I believe medium severity to be valid as any type of misbehavior is contingent on deploying an ERC4626 mixin with a `feeOnTransfer` Token.
> 
> Given the circumstances, the best recommendation for developers is to use the mixin with ERC20 Standard Tokens.
