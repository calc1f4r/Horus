## Vulnerability Title

M-3: Spot dex cant handle fee-on-transfer tokens

### Overview


This bug report is about an issue in the Spot Dex contracts, which do not properly support tokens that implement a fee on transfer. These types of tokens deduct a fee from any transfer of tokens, resulting in the recipient receiving less than the original amount sent. The specific issue lies in the ERC20 token transfer, where the code assumes that the full `order.amount_in` will be transferred to `self`. This assumption is incorrect when the token in question implements a fee on transfer. If a fee is deducted, `self` will receive less tokens than `order.amount_in`, which could potentially halt token swaps midway and lock funds, possibly leading to financial loss for the user. 

To rectify this vulnerability, it's recommended to replace `order.amount_in` with the account of balance of `ERC20(order.token_in)` after the swap minus before the transferFrom call, and add error handling for unsuccessful transfers and approvals.

The bug report was found by 0x4non, 0xStalin, kutugu, and twicek, and the tool used was Manual Review. The bug was initially classified as Medium, but two escalations were made: dot-pengun argued that the bug was invalid because UniswapV3 does not support fee-on-transfer tokens, and twicek argued that the README was ambiguous and the designed behavior seemed compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens. The escalations were accepted, and the bug was kept as a Medium, with the recommendation to improve the codebase to accommodate fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Original Finding Content

## Found by 
0x4non, 0xStalin, kutugu, twicek
## Summary

`Dca.vy`, `LimitOrder.vy` and `TrailingStopDex.vy` does not properly support tokens that implement a fee on transfer. These types of tokens deduct a fee from any transfer of tokens, resulting in the recipient receiving less than the original amount sent. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The specific issue lies in the ERC20 token transfer.

Lests analyze the method `execute_limit_order` focus on lines [LimitOrders.vy#L160-L161](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/spot-dex/LimitOrders.vy#L160-L161), this code assumes that the full `order.amount_in` will be transferred to `self`. This assumption is incorrect when the token in question implements a fee on transfer. When a fee is deducted, `self` will receive less tokens than `order.amount_in`. The subsequent call to `approve` and `ExactInputSingleParams` could therefore potentially fail as they rely on `self` having a balance of `order.amount_in`.

## Impact

This vulnerability could potentially halt token swaps midway if the token involved deducts a transfer fee. This can result in an unsuccessful token swap, which in turn could lock funds and possibly lead to financial loss for the user.

- [TrailingStopDex.vy#L170-L171](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/spot-dex/TrailingStopDex.vy#L170-L171)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To rectify this vulnerability, it's recommended to replace `order.amount_in` with the account of balance of `ERC20(order.token_in)` after the swap minus before the transferFrom call. This ensures that the correct balance (after any potential fees) is used for the approve call and the ExactInputSingleParams. It's also advised to add error handling for unsuccessful transfers and approvals.

Example:
```vy
    balance_before: uint256 = ERC20(order.token_in).balanceOf(self)
    
    # transfer token_in from user to self
    ERC20(order.token_in).transferFrom(order.account, self, order.amount_in)

    correct_amount: uint256 = ERC20(order.token_in).balanceOf(self) - balance_before

    # approve UNISWAP_ROUTER to spend token_in
    ERC20(order.token_in).approve(UNISWAP_ROUTER, correct_amount)

    # Use correct_amount instead of order.amount_in
```



## Discussion

**dot-pengun**

Escalate

The contest page states that only tokens supported by uniswap v3 can be used, as shown below.
> The Spot contracts need to be able to interact with any pool/token, we don’t want to have a centralized whitelist, we want it to work with any Uniswap v3 pool (and later others but this is probably out of scope).

According to the [uniswap V3 docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/integration-issues), uniswap do not support fee-on-transfer tokens, so I believe this issue is invalid.

Escalate for 10 USDC
This sentence implies that any token could be interacted with in the spot contracts:
> The Spot contracts need to be able to interact with any pool/token, we don’t want to have a centralized whitelist, we want it to work with any Uniswap v3 pool (and later others but this is probably out of scope).

The sponsor didn't know that fee-on-transfer tokens couldn't be used in UniswapV3 when writing the README in which fee-on-transfer token related issues are explicitly in scope for the spot dex:

> Q: Are there any FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens interacting with the smart contracts?
Margin: no Spot: possibly

Information acquired after the beginning of the contest and not explicitly mentioned in the README shouldn't supersede the README information.

The README is a little ambiguous.

The designed behavior seems to be compatible with fee on transfer token. And the POC demonstrates that the current codebase needs improvement for this purpose.

Accepting the escalation because it is understandable that it could be confusing, but will keep the issue valid medium.
