## Vulnerability Title

[M-01] If the underlying asset is a fee on transfer token, it could break the internal accounting of the vault

### Overview


A bug has been reported in the `Vault._deposit` function of the PoolTogether protocol. This function is used to deposit `_assets` to the vault and mint vault shares to the `recipient` address. The amount of `_assets` are transferred to the `Vault` using `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom`. The issue is that if the underlying `_asset` is a fee on transfer token then the actual received amount to the vault will be less than what is referred in the `Vault.deposit` function `_assets` input parameter. This could be further aggravated since the `_asset` is again `deposited` to the `_yieldVault` and when needing to be redeemed, will be `withdrawn` from the `_yieldVault` as well. These operations will again charge a fee if the `_asset` is a fee on transfer token. Hence, the actual `_asset` amount left for a particular user will be less than the amount they initially transferred in, resulting in the transaction reverting when the user `redeems` the minted shares back to the `_assets`.

The recommended mitigation step to this bug is to compute the `_assets` amount balance of the contract before and after the `safeTransferFrom` call to get the difference between the two for the "actually transferred" amount to the `Vault`. Then, the "actually transferred" amount can be converted to shares and mint the correct amount of shares to the `recipient`. This mitigation step has been confirmed by asselstine (PoolTogether).

### Original Finding Content


The `Vault._deposit` function is used by the users to deposit `_assets` to the vault and mint vault shares to the `recipient` address. The amount of `_assets` are transferred to the `Vault` as follows:

      SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
        _asset,
        _caller,
        address(this),
        _assetsDeposit != 0 ? _assetsDeposit : _assets
      );

The `Vault.deposit` function uses this `_assets` amount to calculate the number of `shares` to be minted to the `_recipient` address.

The issue here is if the underlying `_asset` is a fee on transfer token then the actual received amount to the vault will be less than what is referred in the `Vault.deposit` function `_assets` input parameter. But the shares to mint is calculated using the entire `_assets` amount.

This issue could be further aggravated since the `_asset` is again `deposited` to the `_yieldVault` and when needing to be redeemed, will be `withdrawn` from the `_yieldVault` as well. These operations will again charge a fee if the `_asset` is a fee on transfer token. Hence, the actual `_asset` amount left for a particular user will be less than the amount they initially transferred in.

Hence, when the user `redeems` the minted shares back to the `_assets`, the contract will not have enough assets to transfer to the `redeemer`, thus reverting the transaction.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
      SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
        _asset,
        _caller,
        address(this),
        _assetsDeposit != 0 ? _assetsDeposit : _assets
      );
```

```solidity
    _yieldVault.deposit(_assets, address(this));

```solidity
    _yieldVault.withdraw(_assets, address(this), address(this));
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(asset()), _receiver, _assets);
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to compute the `_assets` amount balance of the contract before and after the `safeTransferFrom` call to get the difference between the two for the "actually transferred" amount to the `Vault`. Then, the "actually transferred" amount can be converted to shares and mint the correct amount of shares to the `recipient`.

```solidity
  uint256 balanceBefore = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));

      SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
        _asset,
        _caller,
        address(this),
        _assetsDeposit != 0 ? _assetsDeposit : _assets
      );

  uint256 balanceAfter = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));  

  uint256 transferredAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
