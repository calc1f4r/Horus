## Vulnerability Title

[H-05] Wrong liquidation logic

### Overview


This bug report is about an Ethereum address (0x6823636c2462cfdcD8d33fE53fBCD0EdbE2752ad) and a vulnerability in the `belowMaintenanceThreshold` function. The inequality in the last equation is wrong because it says the higher the holdings (margin + loan) compared to the loan, the higher the chance of being liquidated; the inverse equality was probably intended. The impact of this bug is that users that shouldn't be liquidated can be liquidated, and users that should be liquidated cannot get liquidated. The recommended mitigation step is to fix the equation. The reporter of this bug is mail@cmichel.io and @cmichelio.

### Original Finding Content


The `belowMaintenanceThreshold` function decides if a trader can be liquidated:

```solidity
function belowMaintenanceThreshold(CrossMarginAccount storage account)
    internal
    returns (bool)
{
    uint256 loan = loanInPeg(account, true);
    uint256 holdings = holdingsInPeg(account, true);
    // The following should hold:
    // holdings / loan >= 1.1
    // =>
    return 100 * holdings >= liquidationThresholdPercent * loan;
}
```

The inequality in the last equation is wrong because it says the higher the holdings (margin + loan) compared to the loan, the higher the chance of being liquidated. The inverse equality was probably intended `return 100 * holdings <= liquidationThresholdPercent * loan;`. Users that shouldn't be liquidated can be liquidated, and users that should be liquidated cannot get liquidated.
