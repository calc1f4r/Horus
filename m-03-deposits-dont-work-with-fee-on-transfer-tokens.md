## Vulnerability Title

[M-03] Deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens

### Overview


The bug report is about a problem with ERC20 tokens that can be customized. Some tokens have a fee for every transfer, while others increase in value over time. The `RCTreasury.deposit()` function is not accurately recording the amount of deposits received, which can result in users being credited with more deposits than they actually made. The report suggests either making sure the token being used does not have any customizations, or measuring the change in assets before and after transferring them. The issue has been acknowledged by the developer, who has also referenced a previous issue with a similar problem.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by cmichel_

There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts.
One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.
Others are rebasing tokens that increase in value over time like Aave's aTokens (`balanceOf` changes over time).

The `RCTreasury.deposit()` function will credit more deposits than the contract actually received:

```solidity
erc20.safeTransferFrom(msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
user[_user].deposit += SafeCast.toUint128(_amount);
```

Recommend ensuring that the `erc20` token does not implement any customizations.
Alternatively, a mitigation is to measure the asset change right before and after the asset-transferring routines
