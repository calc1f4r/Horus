## Vulnerability Title

[M-01] Possible centralization issue around RandProvider

### Overview


This bug report is about the function `ArtGobblers.upgradeRandProvider()` in the web3 project ArtGobblers. This function allows an admin address to pass a RandProvider with the only restriction being that there is currently no seed requested from the current RandProvider. The RandProvider is the only address eligible to call `ArtGobblers.acceptRandomSeed()`, which is required to perform reveals of minted Gobblers.

This could be abused by a malicious actor to set seeds in his favor, which would deny reveals and hence deny a key aspect of the protocol. The sponsors of the project argued that introducing a governance system to upgrade the rand provider is an overkill, as it should only happen once or twice during the lifetime of the project. However, the judge argued that this is an example of admin privilege and should be flagged as medium severity, as there is no way of ensuring that a randomness provider which is fair is going to be used. The judge recommended the use of a strong multisig to avoid any issues in the future.

### Original Finding Content


[ArtGobblers.sol#L560-L567](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-artgobblers/blob/d2087c5a8a6a4f1b9784520e7fe75afa3a9cbdbe/src/ArtGobblers.sol#L560-L567)<br>

While it is very common for web3 projects to have privileged functions that can only be called by an admin address, special thought should be given to functions that can break core functionality of a project.

One such function is `ArtGobblers.upgradeRandProvider()`. If this is called passing a non-compatible contract address or EOA, requesting new seeds will be bricked and as a consequence reveals will not be possible. Also the seed could be controlled using a custom contract which would allow a malicious actor to set seeds in his favor.

Naturally, the assumption that the deployer or a multisig (likely that ownership will probably be transferred to such) go rogue and perform a malicious action is unlikely to happen as they have a stake in the project (monetary and reputation wise).

However, as this is a project that will be unleashed on launch without any further development and left to form its own ecosystem for many years to come, less centralized options should be considered.

### Proof of Concept

The function `ArtGobblers.upgradeRandProvider()`, allows the owner to arbitrarily pass a RandProvider with the only restriction being that there is currently no seed requested from the current RandProvider:

```js
function upgradeRandProvider(RandProvider newRandProvider) external onlyOwner {
        // Revert if waiting for seed, so we don't interrupt requests in flight.
        if (gobblerRevealsData.waitingForSeed) revert SeedPending();

        randProvider = newRandProvider; // Update the randomness provider.

        emit RandProviderUpgraded(msg.sender, newRandProvider);
    }
```

The RandProvider is the only address eligible (as well as responsible) to call `ArtGobblers.acceptRandomSeed()`, which is required to perform reveals of minted Gobblers:

    function acceptRandomSeed(bytes32, uint256 randomness) external {
            // The caller must be the randomness provider, revert in the case it's not.
            if (msg.sender != address(randProvider)) revert NotRandProvider();

            // The unchecked cast to uint64 is equivalent to moduloing the randomness by 2**64.
            gobblerRevealsData.randomSeed = uint64(randomness); // 64 bits of randomness is plenty.

            gobblerRevealsData.waitingForSeed = false; // We have the seed now, open up reveals.

            emit RandomnessFulfilled(randomness);
        }

This could be abused with the consequences outlined above.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The inclusion of a voting and governance mechanism should be considered for protocol critical functions. This could for example take the form of each Gobbler representing 1 vote, with legendary Gobblers having more weight (literally) based on the amount of consumed Gobblers.

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-artgobblers-findings/issues/327#issuecomment-1265974853):**
 > The warden has shown a few possible risks for end users, because of the privileged function `upgradeRandProvider`, a malicious owner could set the `randProvider` to either a malicious implementation or a faulty implementation.
> 
> This would prevent reveals which, as we know from other findings could cause the inability to mint legendary gobblers with non-zero emission factors.
> 
> Because this is contingent on a malicious Admin, which could deny reveals and hence deny a key aspect of the protocol, I believe Medium Severity to be appropriate

**[FrankieIsLost (Art Gobblers) disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-artgobblers-findings/issues/327#issuecomment-1268985735):**
 > We disagree with severity. This type of griefing attack by admin does not provide any economic benefits. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be any viable alternatives here, as introducing a governance system just to upgrade the rand provider (which should only happen once or twice during the lifetime of the project) seems like overkill 

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-artgobblers-findings/issues/327#issuecomment-1272573396):**
 > I agree with the Sponsors unwillingness to create a complex system to maintain the VRF provider.
> 
> I also must concede that griefing the mint is of dubious economic benefit.
> 
> However, per our rules and historical context I believe this is an example of Admin Privilege, the Admin can change the implementation of the Randomness Provider to their advantage and can deny the mint from continuing.
> 
> I have to agree with a nofix, beside recommending the use of a strong Multisig to avoid any issues in the future.
> 
> However, the in-scope system has no way of:
> - Ensuring a multisig will be used
> - Ensuring that a randomness provider which is fair is going to be used.
> 
> C4 has historically flagged these type of risks as Medium, and for those reasons I believe the correct judgement is Medium Severity.
> 
> We will be discussing these types of findings to provide consistent and transparent judging rules in the future, however, given the historical track record of C4, I believe the right move is to keep it as Medium Severity.
