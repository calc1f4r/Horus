## Vulnerability Title

[H-01] StandardPolicyERC1155.sol returns amount == 1 instead of amount == order.amount

### Overview


This bug report describes an issue with the ```StandardPolicyERC1155.sol``` contract in the BlurExchange. The ```canMatchMakerAsk``` and ```canMatchMakerBid``` functions will only return 1 as the amount instead of the order.amount value, which is then used in the ```_executeTokenTransfer``` call. This leads to only 1 ERC1155 token being sent when a buyer matches an ERC1155 order with amount greater than 1. The buyer would lose overspent ETH/WETH to the seller without receiving all tokens as specified in the order. 

A proof of concept has been provided, which includes code from the ```StandardPolicyERC1155.sol``` contract and a test code added to ```execution.test.ts```. The test code shows a sell order for an ERC1155 token with amount = 10 and a matching buy order, but the buyer only receives 1 token instead of 10 despite paying the full price.

The recommended mitigation step is for policies used for ERC1155 tokens to return and consider the amount of tokens set for the order.

## Vulnerability details

## Impact

The ```canMatchMakerAsk``` and ```canMatchMakerBid``` functions in ```StandardPolicyERC1155.sol``` will only return 1 as the amount instead of the order.amount value. This value is then used in the ```_executeTokenTransfer``` call during the execution flow and leads to only 1 ERC1155 token being sent. A buyer matching an ERC1155 order wih amount > 1 would expect to receive amount of tokens if they pay the order's price. The seller, who might also expect more than 1 tokens to be sent, would have set the order's price to be for the amount of tokens and not just for 1 token.

The buyer would lose overspent ETH/WETH to the seller without receiving all tokens as specified in the order.

## Proof of Concept

[StandardPolicyERC1155.sol:canMatchMakerAsk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/matchingPolicies/StandardPolicyERC1155.sol#L12-L36)

```solidity
    function canMatchMakerAsk(Order calldata makerAsk, Order calldata takerBid)
        external
        pure
        override
        returns (
            bool,
            uint256,
            uint256,
            uint256,
            AssetType
        )
    {
        return (
            (makerAsk.side != takerBid.side) &&
            (makerAsk.paymentToken == takerBid.paymentToken) &&
            (makerAsk.collection == takerBid.collection) &&
            (makerAsk.tokenId == takerBid.tokenId) &&
            (makerAsk.matchingPolicy == takerBid.matchingPolicy) &&
            (makerAsk.price == takerBid.price),
            makerAsk.price,
            makerAsk.tokenId,
            1,
            AssetType.ERC1155
        );
    }
```

The code above shows that ```canMatchMakerAsk``` only returns 1 as the amount. ```_executeTokenTransfer``` will then [call the executionDelegate's ```transferERC1155``` function with only amount 1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L540), transferring only 1 token to the buyer.


Test code added to ```execution.test.ts```:

```typescript
    it('Only 1 ERC1155 received for order with amount > 1', async () => {
      await mockERC1155.mint(alice.address, tokenId, 10);
      sell = generateOrder(alice, {
        side: Side.Sell,
        tokenId,
        amount: 10,
        collection: mockERC1155.address,
        matchingPolicy: matchingPolicies.standardPolicyERC1155.address,
      });
      buy = generateOrder(bob, {
        side: Side.Buy,
        tokenId,
        amount: 10,
        collection: mockERC1155.address,
        matchingPolicy: matchingPolicies.standardPolicyERC1155.address,
      });
      sellInput = await sell.pack();
      buyInput = await buy.pack();

      await waitForTx(exchange.execute(sellInput, buyInput));

      // Buyer only receives 1 token
      expect(await mockERC1155.balanceOf(bob.address, tokenId)).to.be.equal(1);
      await checkBalances(
        aliceBalance,
        aliceBalanceWeth.add(priceMinusFee),
        bobBalance,
        bobBalanceWeth.sub(price),
        feeRecipientBalance,
        feeRecipientBalanceWeth.add(fee),
      );
    });
```

The test code above shows a sell order for an ERC1155 token with amount = 10 and a matching buy order. The ```execute``` function in ```BlurExchange.sol``` is called and the orders are matched but the buyer (bob) only receives 1 token instead of 10 despite paying the full price.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Policies used for ERC1155 tokens should return and consider the amount of tokens set for the order.
