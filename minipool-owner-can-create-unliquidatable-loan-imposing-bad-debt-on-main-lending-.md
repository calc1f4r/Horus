## Vulnerability Title

Minipool owner can create unliquidatable loan, imposing bad debt on main lending pool

### Overview


This bug report describes a medium risk bug in the MiniPoolConfigurator contract. The bug allows the minipool owner to create an unliquidatable loan, which can result in bad debt for the main lending pool. This bug can occur when the minipool owner is not the same entity as the main pool admin and the minipool has borrowing capacity from the main lending pool. To exploit this bug, the minipool owner can deactivate the reserve associated with the collateral of their loan. The recommended fix for this bug is to make a more robust check on the supply of the asset. This bug has been fixed in a recent commit.

### Original Finding Content

## Severity: Medium Risk

## Context
MiniPoolConfigurator.sol#L481-L490

## Description
In the scenario where the minipool owner is not the same entity as the main pool admin, and the minipool has some borrowing capacity from the main lending pool (available flow), the minipool owner can create an unliquidatable loan, forcing bad debt upon the main lending pool. 

Note that initially, the main lending pool owner and minipools owner should be the same entity. The risk reported here would be impactful with the decentralization of minipool ownership in the future. 

To achieve this, the minipool owner can simply deactivate the reserve associated with the collateral of their loan. This is possible due to a flawed `_checkNoLiquidity` for deactivating reserves:

```solidity
// MiniPoolConfigurator.sol#L481-L490
function _checkNoLiquidity(address asset, IMiniPool pool) internal view {
    DataTypes.MiniPoolReserveData memory reserveData = pool.getReserveData(asset);
    uint256 availableLiquidity = IERC20Detailed(asset).balanceOf(reserveData.aTokenAddress); // <<<, !
    require(
        availableLiquidity == 0 && reserveData.currentLiquidityRate == 0,
        Errors.LPC_RESERVE_LIQUIDITY_NOT_0
    );
}
```

## Scenario
Let's examine the concrete way of creating an unliquidatable loan:

### Parameters
| Parameter      | Value      |
|----------------|------------|
| Collateral      | aWETH     |
| Debt            | aUSDC     |
| Available flow  | 500k aUSDC|
| aUSDC Liquidity | 0         |
| aWETH LTV      | 1.2       |

### Steps
- Alice, the minipool owner, deposits $600k of WETH into the minipool and borrows $500k USDC, using all available flow.
- Alice flashloans all of WETH out of the ERC6909 market, enabling the deactivation of the reserve because `_checkNoLiquidity` allows it.

## Recommendation
A more robust check could be made on the supply of the asset:

```solidity
// MiniPoolConfigurator.sol#L481-L490
function _checkNoLiquidity(address asset, IMiniPool pool) internal view {
    DataTypes.MiniPoolReserveData memory reserveData = pool.getReserveData(asset);
    // Before
    // uint256 availableLiquidity = IERC20Detailed(asset).balanceOf(reserveData.aTokenAddress);
    
    // After
    uint256 availableLiquidity = IERC6909(reserveData.aTokenAddress).scaledTotalSupply();
    
    require(
        availableLiquidity == 0 && reserveData.currentLiquidityRate == 0,
        Errors.LPC_RESERVE_LIQUIDITY_NOT_0
    );
}
```

## Cod3x
Fixed in commit df0b9abf.
