## Vulnerability Title

DOS attack by delegating tokens at MAX_DELEGATES = 1024

### Overview


This bug report is about the VotingEscrow.sol#L1212. Any user can delegate the balance of the locked NFT amount to anyone by calling delegate. This is vulnerable to a DOS attack as the delegated tokens are maintained in an array and the VotingEscrow has a safety check of MAX_DELEGATES = 1024 preventing an address from having a huge array. This means that any user with 1024 delegated tokens takes approximately 23M gas to transfer/burn/mint a token which is higher than the current gas limit of the op chain which is 15M. 

The recommendations to fix this are to adjust the MAX_DELEGATES=1024 to 128 and to give an option for users to opt-in or opt-out of delegated tokens. Additionally, a test should be added to the VotingEscrow.t.sol contract to demonstrate the issue.

The bug was fixed in commit 0b47fe. Delegation was reworked to use static balances so that it would no longer have a limit. This required the introduction of permanent locks which are locks that do not decay. The fix was verified by Spearbit.

### Original Finding Content

## Vulnerability Report

## Severity
**High Risk**

## Context
`VotingEscrow.sol#L1212`

## Description
Any user can delegate the balance of the locked NFT amount to anyone by calling `delegate`. As the delegated tokens are maintained in an array that's vulnerable to DOS attack, the VotingEscrow has a safety check of `MAX_DELEGATES = 1024`, preventing an address from having a huge array. 

Given the current implementation, any user with 1024 delegated tokens takes approximately 23M gas to transfer/burn/mint a token. However, the current gas limit of the OP chain is 15M. (ref: Op-scan)

- The current votingEscrow has a limit of `MAX_DELEGATES=1024`. It's approx 23M to transfer/withdraw a token when there are 1024 delegated voting on a token.
- It's cheaper to delegate from an address with a shorter token list to an address with a longer token list. If someone tries to attack a victim's address by creating a new address, a new lock, and delegating to the victim, by the time the attacker hits the gas limit, the victim cannot withdraw/transfer/delegate.

## Recommendation
There's currently no clear hard limit of block size in OP's spec. There's also a chance the OP's sequencer will include a jumbo transaction if funds get locked because of out of gas. Nevertheless, there's no precedent example of such cases, and it's not a desirable situation for users to deal with the risks. Hence, recommend to take the following actions:

1. Adjust the `MAX_DELEGATES` from 1024 to 128.
2. Provide an option for users to opt-out/opt-in. Users will only accept the delegated tokens if they opt-in, or users can opt-out to refuse any uncommissioned delegated tokens.

## Testing Recommendation
Also, recommend adding the following test in `VotingEscrow.t.sol`:

```solidity
contract VotingEscrowTest is BaseTest {
    function testDelegateLimitAttack() public {
        vm.prank(address(owner));
        VELO.transfer(address(this), TOKEN_1M);
        VELO.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        uint tokenId = escrow.createLock(TOKEN_1, 7 days);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < escrow.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1; i++) {
            vm.roll(block.number + 1);
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2);
            address fakeAccount = address(uint160(420 + i));
            VELO.transfer(fakeAccount, 1 ether);
            vm.startPrank(fakeAccount);
            VELO.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
            escrow.createLock(1 ether, MAXTIME);
            escrow.delegate(address(this));
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        uint initialGas = gasleft();
        escrow.withdraw(tokenId);
        uint gasUsed = initialGas - gasleft();
        // @audit: setting 10_000_000 to demonstrate the issue. 2~3M gas limit would be a safer range.
        assertLt(gasUsed, 10_000_000);
    }
}
```
