## Vulnerability Title

High Centralization Risks

### Overview


This report highlights potential issues with the Vector Reserve protocol, specifically regarding its centralization and privileged roles. The protocol owners have full access to deposited funds and can update certain variables, which could lead to compromised funds or outdated exchange rates. The team is advised to use an oracle for tracking rates, disallow removal of tokens if the contract still holds them, and implement a system for managing tokens with specific addresses. They are also recommended to follow best practices for security and key management.

### Original Finding Content

**Update**
Marked as "Acknowledged". The Vector Reserve team provided the following explanation:

> _Expected by design, it is common that LRT/LST protocols have some centralization risk, especially during the bootstrapping phase._

**File(s) affected:**`VectorETH.sol`

**Description:** The Vector Reserve protocol shows high centralization and roles with powerful privileges. While manual deposit management is needed for some protocol features by design, users should be aware of these privileges.

The protocol owners have full access to deposited funds, so off-chain security is also crucial. The Vector Reserve team should follow good practices for key management of privileged addresses as well as extensive testing before executing transactions modifying critical parameters of the protocol.

A feature that requires special mention is the set of rates between deposited LSTs/LRTs and minted vETH. Protocol administrators should have alerts or automatic systems to react in the event of depegs or other price changes to avoid large arbitrage operations when redemptions are enabled.

We have identified some potential issues if the privileged "owner" addresses get compromised or used maliciously:

1.   The `VectorETH` contract allows deposits of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) as long as they are whitelisted. The state variable `vETHPerRestakedLST` keeps track of the exchange rate used to mint and burn vETH. If there is a depeg from the ETH value on any of the whitelisted LSTs, an attacker could take advantage of an outdated rate and get part of the contract funds.
2.   The `VectorETH` contract allows deposits of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) as long as they are whitelisted. The state variable `vETHPerRestakedLST` keeps track of the exchange rate used to mint and burn vETH. According to the team, the rate should normally be 1:1 unless the corresponding LST is generating some yield. However, that variable can be updated by the owner to any arbitrary value which means there is no guarantee that users will get their initial deposit back since the rate could remain outdated if the owner does not update it regularly (or set it to zero). Additionally, a compromised owner could drain the contract completely.
3.   The function `removeRestakedLST()` allows the admin to remove the `vETHPerRestakedLST` amount, even if the contract still holds balance for the given LST. This will prevent users from being able to redeem their LST.
4.   The function `manageRestakedLST()` allows managers to transfer any staked token to an arbitrary address. Instead of allowing a manager to manage all the deposited tokens, the owner should have the option to assign a manager to manage only specific tokens to preset addresses.

**Recommendation:**

1.   Consider using an oracle that keeps track of the current rate between ETH and a given LST.
2.   Disallow removal of LST from the protocol if the contract holds said LST.
3.   It is recommended to have the admin of the protocol set the list of possible addresses that can manage LST. This follows the principle of least privilege, and then the managers can choose which address to send to from the list. Also, the owner should have the option to assign a manager to manage only specific tokens.
4.   Follow best practices for private key management and traditional Web2 security in related systems out of the scope of this audit.
