## Vulnerability Title

[M-05] Centralisation Risk: Admin Can Change Important Variables To Steal Funds

### Overview


This bug report is about a flaw in the code of the '2022-06-illuminate' project on GitHub. It was submitted by kirk-baird and found by several contributors, including 0xDjango, Alex the Entreprenerd, kenzo, Kumpa, pashov, shenwilly, tintin, and unforgiven. The flaw allows the admin to rug-pull the protocol and take all user funds. 

The flaw is present in four methods: `Lender.approve()` on lines #78 and #107, `Lender.setFee()` on line #137, `Lender.withdraw()` on line #145, and `MarketPlace.setPrincipal()` on line #156. `Lender.approve()` allows the admin to approve any token for an arbitrary address and transfer tokens out. `Lender.setFee()` does not have a lower limit and `feeNominator = 1` implies 100% of the amount is taken as fees. `Lender.withdraw()` allows withdrawing any arbitrary ERC20 token, and with only 3 days to withdraw funds, users may not have enough time to do so. Lastly, `MarketPlace.setPrincipal()` allows the admin to set a malicious ERC20 token to which they have infinite supply and call `Lender.mint()` for it.

The recommended mitigation steps are to set all admin functions behind either a timelocked DAO or at least a timelocked multisig contract. This will prevent the admin from being able to rug-pull the protocol. The contributors understand that multisigs are not a solution for decentralization, but feel strongly that certain centralization is necessary for nascent lending protocols when their integration platform is so large. 

In conclusion, this bug report is about a flaw in the code of the '2022-06-illuminate' project on GitHub that allows the admin to rug-pull the protocol and take all user funds. The recommended mitigation steps are to set all admin functions behind either a timelocked DAO or at least a timelocked multisig contract.

### Impact

There are numerous methods that the admin could apply to rug pull the protocol and take all user funds.

*   `Lender.approve()`
    *   Both the functions on lines #78 and #107.
    *   Admin can approve any token for an arbitrary address and transfer tokens out.

*   `Lender.setFee()`
    *   Does not have an lower limit.
    *   `feeNominator = 1` implies 100% of amount is taken as fees.

*   `Lender.withdraw()`
    *   Allows withdrawing any arbitrary ERC20 token
    *   3 Days is insufficient time for users to withdraw funds in the case of a rugpull.

*   `MarketPlace.setPrincipal()`
    *   Use (u, m, 0) -> to be an existing Illuminate PT from another market
    *   Then set (u, m, 1) -> to be some malcious admin created ERC20 token to which they have infinite supply
    *   Then call `Lender.mint()` for \`(u, m, 1) and later redeem these tokens on the original market

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Without significant redesign it is not possible to avoid the admin being able to rug pull the protocol.

As a result the recommendation is to set all admin functions behind either a timelocked DAO or at least a timelocked multisig contract.

 > Input sanitization and centralization is out-of-scope in this contest, however, the arbitrary approval violated.
> > The admin must not be able to withdraw more fees than what he is entitled to and fee calculation is correct.

 > This was not considered part of our threat model. As the remediation suggested, the `admin` address will be DAO-locked behind a multisig. As a result, we do not consider this to be an issue.
