## Vulnerability Title

Missing `LDFType` type validation against `ShiftMode` can result in losses due disabled surge fees

### Overview


This bug report discusses an issue where some liquidity distribution functions (LDFs) do not properly adjust their distribution when using a specific configuration known as `STATIC` variant. This can result in losses for liquidity providers due to manipulation of the market. The issue has been addressed and fixed in a recent code update by Bacon Labs and verified by Cyfrin.

### Original Finding Content

**Description:** While it is not required, some existing LDFs shift their liquidity distribution based on behavior derived from the TWAP oracle. If the `ShiftMode` is specified as the `STATIC` variant, the distribution does not shift; however, the LDF can still have dynamic behavior such as that exhibited by `BuyTheDipGeometricDistribution` which switches between alpha parameters depending on the arithmetic mean tick and immutable threshold. For non-static LDFs, `ILiquidityDensityFunction::isValidParams` validates that the TWAP duration is non-zero for non-static shift modes, such that there is never a case where an LDF shifts but there is no valid TWAP value to use.

The `LDFType` is a separate but related configuration specified in the LDF parameters and used in the `BunniHub` to define the surge fee behavior and usage of `s.ldfStates`. Here, the `STATIC` variant defines a stateless LDF (from the perspective of the `BunniHook`) that has no dynamic behavior and, assuming rehypothecation is enabled, surges only based on changes in the vault share price; however, if the `ShiftMode` is not `STATIC` then this disabling of surge fees can result in losses to liquidity providers due to MEV.

It is understood that it is not currently possible to create such a pool using the Bunni UI, though such configs are possible on the smart contract level.

**Impact:** Liquidity providers may be subject to losses due to MEV when surge fees are disabled for static LDFs that exhibit shifting behavior.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider enforcing on the smart contract level that a shifting liquidity distribution must correspond to a non-static LDF type.

**Bacon Labs:** Fixed in [PR \#101](https://github.com/timeless-fi/bunni-v2/pull/101).

**Cyfrin:** Verified, a new `ldfType` parameter has been added to `isValidParams()` to validate the required combinations of `ldfType` and `shiftMode` in LDFs.
