## Vulnerability Title

[M-01] RewardsPool.sol : It is safe to have the startRewardsCycle with WhenNotPaused modifier

### Overview


A bug report has been identified in the RewardsPool.sol contract code, which is part of the code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool GitHub repository. The bug is related to the startRewardsCycle function, which does not have the WhenNotPaused modifier. This could lead to an inflation of the token value when the contract is paused, which is not safe and could lead to rewards being claimed by other parties during the paused period.

The bug was identified through manual review. To mitigate the issue, it is suggested to use the WhenNotPaused modifier. This would ensure that rewards are not claimed during the paused period, and that the inflation does not consider the paused duration.

### Original Finding Content

## Lines of code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol#L155-L197


## Vulnerability details

## Impact
when the contract is paused , allowing startRewardsCycle would inflate the token value which might not be safe.

Rewards should not be claimed by anyone when all other operations are paused.

I saw that the `witdrawGGP` has this `WhenNotPaused` modifier.

Inflate should not consider the paused duration.

lets say, when the contract is paused for theduration of 2 months, then the dao, protocol, and node validator would enjoy the rewards. This is not good for a health protocol

## Proof of Concept

startRewardsCycle does not have the WhenNotPaused modifier.

	function startRewardsCycle() external {
		if (!canStartRewardsCycle()) {
			revert UnableToStartRewardsCycle();
		}


		emit NewRewardsCycleStarted(getRewardsCycleTotalAmt());


		// Set start of new rewards cycle
		setUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.RewardsCycleStartTime"), block.timestamp);
		increaseRewardsCycleCount();
		// Mint any new tokens from GGP inflation
		// This will always 'mint' (release) new tokens if the rewards cycle length requirement is met
		// 		since inflation is on a 1 day interval and it needs at least one cycle since last calculation
		inflate();


		uint256 multisigClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimMultisig");
		uint256 nopClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimNodeOp");
		uint256 daoClaimContractAllotment = getClaimingContractDistribution("ClaimProtocolDAO");
		if (daoClaimContractAllotment + nopClaimContractAllotment + multisigClaimContractAllotment > getRewardsCycleTotalAmt()) {
			revert IncorrectRewardsDistribution();
		}


		TokenGGP ggp = TokenGGP(getContractAddress("TokenGGP"));
		Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));


		if (daoClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
			emit ProtocolDAORewardsTransfered(daoClaimContractAllotment);
			vault.transferToken("ClaimProtocolDAO", ggp, daoClaimContractAllotment);
		}


		if (multisigClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
			emit MultisigRewardsTransfered(multisigClaimContractAllotment);
			distributeMultisigAllotment(multisigClaimContractAllotment, vault, ggp);
		}


		if (nopClaimContractAllotment > 0) {
			emit ClaimNodeOpRewardsTransfered(nopClaimContractAllotment);
			ClaimNodeOp nopClaim = ClaimNodeOp(getContractAddress("ClaimNodeOp"));
			nopClaim.setRewardsCycleTotal(nopClaimContractAllotment);
			vault.transferToken("ClaimNodeOp", ggp, nopClaimContractAllotment);
		}
	}

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

We suggest to use `WhenNotPaused` modifier.
