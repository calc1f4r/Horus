## Vulnerability Title

[ACKNOWLEDGED] Floating pragma in the contracts of the scope

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description
All the contracts in the scope use the following pragma statement:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
```
This allows for the situation that the contracts get deployed with the compiler version different from the one they were tested with, which exposes the system to higher risks of undiscovered bugs.
##### Recommendation
We recommend locking the pragma statement to a specific compiler version intended by the developers. This will help ensure that the contracts are deployed with the intended compiler version and minimize the risks of undiscovered bugs.
