## Vulnerability Title

[M-05] Missing rescue reward function in `Gauge`, `CLGauge`, `Bribes`

### Overview


The report describes a bug where rewards are not distributed to certain contracts due to a possible zero total supply. This can result in no rewards being distributed during a reward period. The bug is considered to have a high impact but a low likelihood of occurring. The report recommends adding functionality to rescue the rewards to fix the issue.

### Original Finding Content

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

## Description

When rewards are distributed to `Gauge`, `CLGauge`, and Bribes contracts via `notifyRewardAmount`, it's possible that the total supply is 0 during that reward period/epoch, resulting in no rewards being distributed.

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
        require(amount > 0);
        if (!isReward[token]) {
            require(
                IVoter(voter).isWhitelisted(token),
                "bribe tokens must be whitelisted"
            );
            require(
                rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS,
                "too many rewards tokens"
            );
        }
        // bribes kick in at the start of next bribe period
        uint adjustedTstamp = getEpochStart(block.timestamp);
        uint epochRewards = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp];

        _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp] = epochRewards + amount;

        periodFinish[token] = adjustedTstamp + DURATION;

        if (!isReward[token]) {
            isReward[token] = true;
            rewards.push(token);
        }

        emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, adjustedTstamp, amount);
    }
```

However, those contracts lack functionality to rescue the rewards, causing the distributed rewards to become permanently stuck inside them.

## Recommendations

Add functionality to rescue the rewards.
