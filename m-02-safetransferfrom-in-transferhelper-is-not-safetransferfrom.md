## Vulnerability Title

[M-02] safeTransferFrom in TransferHelper is not safeTransferFrom

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in a non-standard ERC20 token. When a user creates a USDT/DAI pool and deposits into the pool, they would find out there is never a counterpart deposit. The issue is that the TransferHelper contract does not use the SafeERC20 library as the function name implies. A sample Proof of Concept is included in the report, which shows an error message when the deposit is attempted. The bug was discovered using Hardhat, and the recommended mitigation step is to use the openzeppelin SafeERC20 library in the TransferHelper contract and any other contracts that use IERC20.

## Vulnerability details

## Impact
A non standard erc20 token would always raise error when calling `_safeTransferFrom`.  If a user creates a USDT/DAI pool and deposit into the pool he would find out there's never a counterpart deposit.

## Proof of Concept

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-wildcredit/blob/82c48d73fd27a9d4d5d4a395b3affcef4ef6c5c8/contracts/TransferHelper.sol#L19

TransferHelper does not uses `SafeERC20` library as the function name implies. 

A sample POC:
script:
```
usdt.functions.approve(lending_pair.address, deposit_amount).transact({'from': w3.eth.accounts[0]})
lending_pair.functions.deposit(w3.eth.accounts[0], usdt.address, deposit_amount).transact({'from': w3.eth.accounts[0]})
```

Error Message:
```
  Error: Transaction reverted: function returned an unexpected amount of data
      at LendingPair._safeTransferFrom (contracts/TransferHelper.sol:20)
      at LendingPair.deposit (contracts/LendingPair.sol:95)
```
## Tools Used

Hardhat

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Uses openzeppelin `SafeERC20` in transfer helper (and any other contract that uses IERC20).
