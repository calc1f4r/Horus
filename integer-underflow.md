## Vulnerability Title

INTEGER UNDERFLOW

### Overview


The bug report describes an issue where calling the `increaseTotalRedelegated` function is causing an error in the `startUndelegation` function. This error prevents the user from withdrawing their deposited BNB. The code responsible for this error is located in the `StakeManager.sol` file. The `startUndelegation` function performs a subtraction that results in an underflow, causing the transaction to fail. This is due to the `totalBnbToWithdraw` value being calculated incorrectly in the `requestWithdraw` function, which is used in the `startUndelegation` function. The impact of this bug is rated as 5 out of 10 and the likelihood of it occurring is rated as 3 out of 10. The recommended solution is to add a check in the `addRestakingRewards` function and to recalculate the BnbX/BNB ratio in the `startUndelegation` function. This bug has been solved.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description

Calling the `increaseTotalRedelegated` function is causing an integer underflow in the `startUndelegation` function.

If the `totalRedelegated` amount is increased by calling `increaseTotalRedelegated`, the `startUndelegation` transaction will revert with: `Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside an unchecked block` error (in Solidity > 0.8).
Because the undelegation process will fail, the user will not be able to withdraw the deposited BNB.

Code Location
-------------

The `startUndelegation` function performs a subtraction:

#### StakeManager.sol

```
function startUndelegation()
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(BOT)
    returns (uint256 _uuid, uint256 _amount)
{
    require(totalBnbToWithdraw > 0, "No Request to withdraw");

    _uuid = undelegateUUID++;
    _amount = totalBnbToWithdraw;
    uuidToBotUndelegateRequestMap[_uuid] = BotUndelegateRequest(
        block.timestamp,
        0,
        _amount
    );

    totalDeposited -= _amount;
    uint256 bnbXToBurn = totalBnbXToBurn; // To avoid Reentrancy attack
    totalBnbXToBurn = 0;
    totalBnbToWithdraw = 0;

    IBnbX(bnbX).burn(address(this), bnbXToBurn);
}

```

Where `totalDeposited` is an amount of BNB deposited and `_amount` is the value of `totalBnbToWithdraw` that is calculated in the `requestWithdraw` function:

#### StakeManager.sol

```
function requestWithdraw(uint256 _amount) external override whenNotPaused {
    require(_amount > 0, "Invalid Amount");
    uint256 amountInBnb = convertBnbXToBnb(_amount);

    IERC20Upgradeable(bnbX).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        _amount
    );
    uint256 totalStakedBnb = getTotalStakedBnb();
    require(
        amountInBnb <= (totalStakedBnb - totalBnbToWithdraw),
        "Not enough BNB to withdraw"
    );

    totalBnbToWithdraw += amountInBnb;
    totalBnbXToBurn += _amount;
    userWithdrawalRequests[msg.sender].push(
        WithdrawalRequest(undelegateUUID, amountInBnb, block.timestamp)
    );

    emit RequestWithdraw(msg.sender, _amount, amountInBnb);
}

```

The value taken from `convertBnbXToBnb` is added to `totalBnbToWithdraw`. The `convertBnbXToBnb` function calculates its value based on the output of `getTotalPooledBnb`:

#### StakeManager.sol

```
uint256 totalPooledBnb = getTotalPooledBnb();

```

Which is using `totalRedelegated` set by the `increaseTotalRedelegated` function:

#### StakeManager.sol

```
function getTotalPooledBnb() public view override returns (uint256) {
    return (totalDeposited + totalRedelegated);
}

```

##### Score

Impact: 5  
Likelihood: 3

##### Recommendation

**SOLVED:** The `addRestakingRewards` function (previously called `increaseTotalRedelegated`), now contains a check: the amount delegated must be greater than 0 to increase. Also, the `startUndelegation` function recalculates the BnbX/BNB ratio, instead of using a previously calculated one.
