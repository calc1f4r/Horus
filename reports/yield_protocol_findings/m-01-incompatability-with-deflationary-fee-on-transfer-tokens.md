## Vulnerability Title

[M-01] Incompatability with deflationary / fee-on-transfer tokens

### Overview


This bug report is about the `DInterest.deposit` function in the code. The `depositAmount` parameter of the function is not the actual transferred amount for fee-on-transfer / deflationary (or other rebasing) tokens. This means that the actual deposited amount might be lower than the specified `depositAmount` of the function parameter, leading to wrong interest rate calculations on the principal. To fix this, it is recommended to transfer the tokens first and compare pre-/after token balances to compute the actual deposited amount.

### Original Finding Content


The `DInterest.deposit` function takes a `depositAmount` parameter but this parameter is not the actual transferred amount for fee-on-transfer / deflationary (or other rebasing) tokens.

The actual deposited amount might be lower than the specified `depositAmount` of the function parameter.

This would lead to wrong interest rate calculations on the principal.

Recommend transferring the tokens first and comparing pre-/after token balances to compute the actual deposited amount.

> While this is true, we have no plans to support fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens.
