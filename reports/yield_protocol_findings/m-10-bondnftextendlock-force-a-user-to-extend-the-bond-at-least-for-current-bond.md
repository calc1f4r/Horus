## Vulnerability Title

[M-10] BondNFT.extendLock force a user to extend the bond at least for current bond.period

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in the current implementation of the BondNFT.sol contract. The current ```BondNFT.extendLock``` function forces a user to extend their bonds for at least their current bond period. This means that, for instance, a bond which was initially locked for 365 can never be extended, even after a week of being created.

The impact of this vulnerability is that users who want to extend their bond are forced to extend them at least for their current bond period. Additionally, bonds which were set with a lock period of 365 days can not be extended, even after days of their creation.

A proof of concept (POC) is provided for this vulnerability. It describes a scenario in which a user creates a bond for 10 days, and then tries to extend it for 3 days after 5 days have passed. However, due to the current implementation, the user is forced to extend the bond for 13 days. After 8 days, the user is still not able to release the bond.

The mitigation steps for this vulnerability are to refactor the ```BondNFT.extendLock``` function. This includes changing the implementation to allow users to extend their bond period for less than their current bond period, and also to respect the minimum bond period when extending a bond.

## Vulnerability details

## Description
The current implementation forces a user to extend their bonds for at least they current bond period. These mean that, for instance, a bond which was initially locked for 365 can never be extended, even after a week of being created.

If we consider that a bond should have at least a 7 days lock and at the most 365 days, then the current ```BondNFT.extendLock``` function should be refactored.

## Impact
* Current ```BondNFT.extendLock``` function does not work as expected, forcing user who want to extend their bond to extend them at least for their current bond.period.
* For bonds which were set with a lock period of 365 days, they can not be extended, even after days of their creation.

## POC
```typescript
// In 09.Bond.js,  describe "Extending lock"
it("POC: Extending the lock does not work as expected", async function () {
      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(user.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
      // user lock bond funds for 10 days
      await lock.connect(user).lock(StableToken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), 10);

      const fiveDaysTime = 5 * 24 * 60 * 60
      const eightDaysTime = 8 * 24 * 60 * 60

      // owner distribute rewards
      console.log("User created a lock for 10 days")
      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(owner.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"));
      await bond.connect(owner).distribute(stabletoken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"));

      // Five days pass
      await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [fiveDaysTime]); // Skip 10 days
      await network.provider.send("evm_mine");
      console.log("\n5 days pass")

      // User decide to extend their lock three days, given the current implementation the user is forced to extended 13 days
      const bondInfoBeforeExtension = await bond.idToBond(1)
      console.log(`Bond info before extension: {period: ${bondInfoBeforeExtension.period}, expireEpoch: ${bondInfoBeforeExtension.expireEpoch}}`)
      
      await lock.connect(user).extendLock(1, 0, 3)
      console.log("Bond was extended for 3 days")
      const bondInfoAfterExtension = await bond.idToBond(1)
      console.log(`Bond info after extension: {period: ${bondInfoAfterExtension.period}, expireEpoch: ${bondInfoAfterExtension.expireEpoch}}`)

      // 8 days pass, user should be able to release the bond given the extension of 3 days (8 days should be enough)
      await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [eightDaysTime]);
      await network.provider.send("evm_mine");
      console.log("\n8 days later")
      console.log("After 13 days (10 original days + 3 days from extension) the user can not release the bond")
      
      // The user decide to claim their part and get their bond amount
      // The user should recieve all the current funds in the contract
      await expect(lock.connect(user).release(1)).to.be.revertedWith('!expire')

    });
```

## Mitigation steps
In order to ```extendLock``` to work properly, the current implementation  should be changed to:
```diff
function extendLock(
    uint _id,
    address _asset,
    uint _amount,
    uint _period,
    address _sender
) external onlyManager() {
    Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);
    Bond storage _bond = _idToBond[_id];
    require(bond.owner == _sender, "!owner");
    require(!bond.expired, "Expired");
    require(bond.asset == _asset, "!BondAsset");
    require(bond.pending == 0); //Cannot extend a lock with pending rewards
+   uint currentEpoch = block.timestamp/DAY;
-   require(epoch[bond.asset] == block.timestamp/DAY, "Bad epoch");
    require(epoch[bond.asset] == currentEpoch, "Bad epoch");

+   uint pendingEpochs = bond.expireEpoch - currentEpoch;
+   uint newBondPeriod = pendingEpochs + _period;
+   //In order to respect min bond period when we extend a bon
+   // Next line can be omitted at discretion of the protocol and devs
+   // If it is omitted any created bond would be able to be extended always (except from those with period = 365)
+   require(newBondPeriod >= 7, "MIN PERIOD");

-    require(bond.period+_period <= 365, "MAX PERIOD");
+    require(newBondPeriod <= 365, "MAX PERIOD");
    
    unchecked {
-       uint shares = (bond.amount + _amount) * (bond.period + _period) / 365;
+       uint shares = (bond.amount + _amount) * newBondPeriod / 365;

-       uint expireEpoch = block.timestamp/DAY + bond.period + _period;
+       uint expireEpoch = currentEpoch + newBondPeriod;

        totalShares[bond.asset] += shares-bond.shares;
        _bond.shares = shares;
        _bond.amount += _amount;
        _bond.expireEpoch = expireEpoch;
        _bond.period += _period;
        _bond.mintTime = block.timestamp; 
-       _bond.mintEpoch = epoch[bond.asset];
+       _bond.mintEpoch = currentEpoch;
-       bondPaid[_id][bond.asset] = accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] * _bond.shares / 1e18;
+       bondPaid[_id][bond.asset] = accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][currentEpoch] * _bond.shares / 1e18;
    }
    emit ExtendLock(_period, _amount, _sender,  _id);
}
```
