## Vulnerability Title

Privileged Roles and Ownership

### Overview


The client has addressed an issue in their smart contract by adding multiple roles using the OpenZeppelin AccessControl Mechanism. However, there is still minimal documentation surrounding these roles and it cannot be guaranteed that they will be held by different addresses. The `wstTAO` contract also contains a `contract owner` with special privileges, which can result in the loss of tokens for all users if compromised. To mitigate this, the client should consider delegating separate roles for different contract functions and separating the pausability to another role. 

### Original Finding Content

**Update**
Marked as "Mitigated" by the client. Addressed in: `41572d44633d85ccd30045ee05ac7eea947da772`, `4f909f7d5bef2f804f96775417aa0e55f5b1e0ce`. The client provided the following explanation:

> Added multiple roles using OpenZeppelin AccessControl Mechanism. There are 5 distinct roles created:
> 
> 
> 1.   PAUSE_ROLE → Control role that can pause contract.
> 2.   EXCHANGE_UPDATE_ROLE → Control role that can update the exchange rate, lower and upper bound.
> 3.   MANAGE_STAKING_CONFIG_ROLE → Control role that can modify staking related information such as the max deposit, unstake, vault and withdrawal manager, native token receiver, update maximum supply.
> 4.   TOKEN_SAFE_PULL_ROLE → Determines user that can call both safePullERC20 and pullNativeToken
> 5.   APPROVE_WITHDRAWAL_ROLE → Control the user that can call approveMultipleUnstakes

This issue has been mitigated by including various roles to separate the privilege within the smart contract. However, as these roles are not assigned in the contracts themselves, we cannot guarantee that they will be held by different addresses. There is still minimal documentation surrounding these privileged roles. Furthermore, with the use of roles for privileged actions, there is no longer a need to include `Ownable2Step` in this contract.

**File(s) affected:**`wstTAO.sol`

**Description:** Smart contracts will often have `owner` variables to designate the person with special privileges to make modifications to the smart contract.

The `wstTAO` contract contains. acontract owner that can do the following:

*   `setServiceFee()` allowing the owner to specify how much native token is required to perform an unstaking operation
*   `setWithdrawalManager()` allowing the owner to specify another address that can approve withdrawals
*   `setMinStakingAmt()` allowing the owner to specify the minimum amount of `wTAO` that needs to be deposited to make a stake
*   `setStakingFee()` allowing the owner to specify how much `wTAO` must be paid to Tensorplex when performing a staking operation
*   `setMaxDepositPerRequest()` allowing the owner to specify the maximum amount of `wTAO` that can be wrapped and staked t a cvertain time
*   `setMaxUnstakeRequest()` allowing the owner to specify the maximum amount of unstake requests that a user can have at any given point in time
*   `setLowerExchangeRateBound()`/`setUpperExchangeRateBound()` allowing the owner to specify the upper and lower bounds that the exchange rate must be set between
*   `setPaused()` allowing the owner to specify whether the contract is paused or not. A paused contract does not allow for staking or unstaking operations
*   `setUnstakingFee()` allowing the owner to specify the unstaking fee charged to a user in wTAO
*   `setWTAO()` allowing the owner to assign the address of the wrappedTAO token that is used for staking operations
*   `setNativeTokenReceiver()` allowing the owner to specify the address off the wallet receiving the TAO after bridging.
*   `safePullERC20()` allowing the owner to send any amount of any tokens held by the contract to any addresd. **A compromised owner can drain the contract of any token holdings.**
*   `pullNativeToken()` allowing the owner to send the full native token balance of the contract. to any address.
*   `approveMultipleUnstakes()` and approve unstakes for users who have requested

Uncareful configuration of these values can result in the contract stopping to operate or result in the loss of wTAO tokens **for all users of the protocol** (e.g. if the exchange rate and the bounds were set to zero by a malicious user who compromised the private keys of the `owner` address).

**Recommendation:** This centralization of power needs to be made clear to the users, especially depending on the level of privilege the contract allows to the owner. To mitigate the impact of a compromised owner, consider delegating separate roles for different contract functions. For example, updating the exchange rate and updating the exchange rate bounds can be provisioned to different roles. We also strongly recommend separating the pausability to another role, as we explain further in [](https://al.quantstamp.com/report/69335176-ae0d-4695-b63b-8ab749feb24c#findings-qs19)[TPLX-19](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/tensorplex-stake/7a7c3615-5f16-4129-86e6-ee4f37fdaf0a/index.html#findings-qs19).
