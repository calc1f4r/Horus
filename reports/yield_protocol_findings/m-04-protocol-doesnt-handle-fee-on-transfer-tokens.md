## Vulnerability Title

[M-04] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens

### Overview


A bug has been reported in the code of the Gravity.sol file in the code-423n4/2022-05-cudos repository on Github. The vulnerability has the potential to drain other user's funds if a token with a fee on transfer is chosen. This is demonstrated by a proof of concept in which Alice sends 100 tokens to the Gravity.sol contract, then withdraws 100 tokens, resulting in a net loss of 5% of the tokens. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the code be changed to the code snippet provided. This code snippet includes a function to safely transfer tokens from the sender to the Gravity.sol contract while also emitting an event to track the amount of tokens transferred.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by wuwe1, also found by cccz, defsec, dipp, Dravee, GermanKuber, GimelSec, jah, reassor, and WatchPug_

[Gravity.sol#L600](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/main/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L600)<br>

Since the `_tokenContract` can be any token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, other user's funds might be drained.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Assume transfer fee to be 5% and `Gravity.sol` has 200 token.
2.  Alice sendToCosmos 100 token. Now, `Gravity.sol` has 295 token.
3.  Alice calls the send-to-eth method to withdraw 100 token.
4.  `Gravity.sol` ends up having 195 token.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to

```solidity
	function sendToCosmos(
		address _tokenContract,
		bytes32 _destination,
		uint256 _amount
	) public nonReentrant  {
                uint256 oldBalance = IERC20(_tokenContract).balanceOf(address(this));
		IERC20(_tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
                uint256 receivedAmout = IERC20(_tokenContract).balanceOf(address(this)) - oldBalance;
		state_lastEventNonce = state_lastEventNonce.add(1);
		emit SendToCosmosEvent(
			_tokenContract,
			msg.sender,
			_destination,
			receivedAmout,
			state_lastEventNonce
		);
	}
```

 > Token transfers are restricted to the Cudos token which doesn't support fee on transfer. Will be fixed with [issue #58](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/58).
