## Vulnerability Title

Missing TokenAccount Checks

### Overview


This bug report describes a vulnerability in the program's WithdrawV2 instruction, which allows an attacker to withdraw tokens from any TokenAccount owned by the pool authority. This could result in the theft of valuable tokens from the liquidity provider vault. The report also includes a proof of concept and recommends checking the provided account against the reward vault and validating underlying mint for all TokenAccounts. The bug has been fixed in the latest update.

### Original Finding Content

## WithdrawV2 Instruction Vulnerability

In the WithdrawV2 instruction, the program does not validate the `vault_reward_token_b_info` account. This could allow an attacker to withdraw tokens from any `TokenAccount` owned by the pool authority. In this case, the attacker would be able to withdraw from either `reward_vault_a` or the liquidity provider vault.

This is extremely dangerous as tokens from the liquidity provider vault could potentially be worth much more than the tokens from `reward_vault_b`. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability to withdraw all liquidity provider tokens from the pool.

The affected code can be found in the code snippet below, wherein it can be seen that no checks are performed on `vault_reward_token_b_info`.

```rust
doubleReward/src/processor.rs RUST
let dest_reward_token_b_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
let vault_reward_token_b_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
[...]
if pending_b > 0 {
    Self::token_transfer_with_authority(
        stake_pool_info.key,
        token_program_info.clone(),
        vault_reward_token_b_info.clone(),
        dest_reward_token_b_info.clone(),
        authority_info.clone(),
        stake_pool.nonce as u8,
        pending_b
    )?;
}
```

## Real World Impact

The numbers below are borrowed from [Raydium Farms](https://raydium.io/farms/) (accessed on June 21, 2022). Using a small off-chain program, OtterSec iterated through every listed StakePool and calculated the possible profits, in LP tokens, for an attacker. Listed below are the most profitable and fastest target farms for an attacker.

**Raydium Staking Audit 04 | Vulnerabilities**

An attacker can multiply their deposited amount by 20 times in a single day using the BTC - stSOL farm. This farm has an estimated total value of $671,327. It is believed that a majority of these LP tokens were vulnerable. In this scenario, the attacker’s actions are indistinguishable from a normal user right up until the deposit/withdraw instruction is invoked using the wrong (crafted) vault accounts.

In some cases, the attacker would be able to approximately double their deposited LP tokens by waiting for a day's worth of rewards to accumulate:
- **mSOL - USDT** estimated total value: $315,131.
- **ETH - stSOL** estimated total value: $707,470.

The same strategy could be used to steal LP tokens from another farm; stealing from other farms would likely take longer. Additionally, there’s a risk of the attacker abusing this vulnerability to withdraw reward tokens from vault A instead of vault B.

## Proof of Concept

1. Initialize farm with two reward tokens. We’ll call them A and B tokens.
   - `reward_per_slot_a` is set to 10,000
   - `reward_per_slot_b` is set to 10,000
2. Victim deposits 50,000 liquidity pool (LP) tokens to the farm.
3. Attacker deposits 10 LP tokens to the farm.
4. Attacker waits for 9,000 slots to pass, which is roughly equivalent to one hour.
5. Attacker calls the WithdrawV2 instruction:
   - Amount of LPs to withdraw is set to 10.
   - `vault_reward_token_b` is set to the farm’s LP token account.
   - `dest_reward_token_b` is set to the attacker’s LP token account.
6. The program calculates the size of B token reward to be 18,000.
7. Attacker receives 18,000 LP tokens instead of 18,000 B tokens.

## Remediation

The account provided in `vault_reward_token_b_info` must be checked against `stake_pool.reward_vault_b`. Moreover, it is recommended to validate the underlying mint for all `TokenAccounts`.

## Patch

The account is now checked against `stake_pool.reward_vault_b`. Fixed in commit `a2a2b52`.
