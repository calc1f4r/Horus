## Vulnerability Title

[M-02] NonUSTStrategy.sol Improper handling of swap fees allows attacker to steal funds from other users

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in the NonUSTStrategy contract of the 2022-01-sandclock project. The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the swap fees paid by other users by taking a majority share of the liquidity pool. This is because the swap fee of depositing is not paid by the depositor but evenly distributed among all users. An example of how this can be exploited is given in the report, along with a recommendation to change the way new shares are issued. This would ensure that the depositor pays for the swap fee and slippage.

## Vulnerability details

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/strategy/NonUSTStrategy.sol#L66-L69

`NonUSTStrategy` will swap the deposited non-UST assets into UST before depositing to EthAnchor. However, the swap fee is not attributed to the depositor correctly like many other yield farming vaults involving swaps (`ZapIn`).

An attacker can exploit it for the swap fees paid by other users by taking a majority share of the liquidity pool.

## Root Cause

The swap fee of depositing is not paid by the depositor but evenly distributed among all users.

## PoC

Given:

- A NonUST vault and strategy is created for `FRAX`;
- The liquidity in FRAX-UST curve pool is relatively small (<$1M).

The attacker can do the following:

1. Add $1M worth of liquidity to the FRAX-UST curve pool, get >50% share of the pool;
2. Deposit 1M FRAX to the vault, get a `depositAmount` of 1M;
3. The strategy will swap 1M FRAX to UST via the curve pool, paying a certain amount of swap fee;
4. Withdraw all the funds from the vault.
5. Remove the liquidity added in step 1, profit from the swap fee. (A majority portion of the swap fee paid in step 3 can be retrieved by the attacker as the attacker is the majority liquidity provider.)

If the vault happens to have enough balance (from a recent depositor), the attacker can now receive 1M of FRAX.

A more associated attacker may combine this with issue [WP-M4] and initiate a sandwich attack in step 3 to get even higher profits.

As a result, all other users will suffer fund loss as the swap fee is essentially covered by other users.

## Recommendation

Consider changing the way new shares are issued:

1. Swap from Vault asset (eg. FRAX) to UST in `deposit()`;
2. Using the UST amount out / total underlying UST for the amount of new shares issued to the depositor.

In essence, the depositor should be paying for the swap fee and slippage.
