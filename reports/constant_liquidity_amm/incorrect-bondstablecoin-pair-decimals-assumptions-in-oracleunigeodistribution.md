## Vulnerability Title

Incorrect bond/stablecoin pair decimals assumptions in `OracleUniGeoDistribution`

### Overview


The OracleUniGeoDistribution contract has a bug that causes incorrect limits to be computed for the LDF (linear distribution formula). This is due to the assumption that both the bond and the stablecoin will have the same number of decimals. However, if the stablecoin has a different number of decimals, the computed tick will be wrong. This can be seen in real examples where the difference in decimals results in a large difference in the computed tick. To fix this, the decimals of the bond and stablecoin should be factored into the calculation of the sqrt price. The team has acknowledged the issue and is working on a solution. 

### Original Finding Content

**Description:** The `OracleUniGeoDistribution` intends to compute a geometric or uniform distribution with two limits; one is arbitrarily set by the owner, and the other is derived from an external price oracle. The price of the bond is returned in terms of USD in 18 decimals before it is converted to a `sqrtPriceX96` by `OracleUniGeoDistribution::floorPriceToRick` which unscales the WAD (18 decimal) precision:

```solidity
function floorPriceToRick(uint256 floorPriceWad, int24 tickSpacing) public view returns (int24 rick) {
    // convert floor price to sqrt price
    // assume bond is currency0, floor price's unit is (currency1 / currency0)
    // unscale by WAD then rescale by 2**(96*2), then take the sqrt to get sqrt(floorPrice) * 2**96
    uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = ((floorPriceWad << 192) / WAD).sqrt().toUint160();
    // convert sqrt price to rick
    rick = sqrtPriceX96.getTickAtSqrtPrice();
    rick = bondLtStablecoin ? rick : -rick; // need to invert the sqrt price if bond is currency1
    rick = roundTickSingle(rick, tickSpacing);
}
```

This computation assumes that both the bond and the stablecoin will have the same number of decimals; however, consider the following example:

* Assuming the bond is valued at exactly 1 USD, the price oracle will return `1e18` and the `sqrtPriceX96` will be computed with `1` based on a 1:1 ratio.
* This is well implemented so long as both currencies have the same number of decimals because it will match the ratio. Assume that the bond has 18 decimals and the stablecoin is DAI, also with 18 decimals.
* The price will be `1e18 / 1e18 = 1`, so the tick will be properly computed.
* On the other hand, if the bond is paired with a stablecoin with a different number of decimals, the computed tick will be wrong. In the case of USDC, the price would be `1e18 / 1e6 = 1e12`. This tick value differs significantly from the actual value that should have been computed.

**Impact:** Bonds paired with stablecoins with a differing number of decimals will be affected, computing incorrect limits for the LDF.

**Proof of Concept:** Consider the following real examples:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

import "./BaseTest.sol";

interface IUniswapV3PoolState {
    function slot0()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint160 sqrtPriceX96,
            int24 tick,
            uint16 observationIndex,
            uint16 observationCardinality,
            uint16 observationCardinalityNext,
            uint8 feeProtocol,
            bool unlocked
        );
}

contract DecimalsPoC is BaseTest {
    function setUp() public override {
        super.setUp();
    }

    function test_slot0PoC() public {
        uint256 mainnetFork;
        string memory MAINNET_RPC_URL = vm.envString("MAINNET_RPC_URL");
        mainnetFork = vm.createFork(MAINNET_RPC_URL);
        vm.selectFork(mainnetFork);

        address DAI_WETH = 0xa80964C5bBd1A0E95777094420555fead1A26c1e;
        address USDC_WETH = 0x7BeA39867e4169DBe237d55C8242a8f2fcDcc387;

        (uint160 sqrtPriceX96DAI,,,,,,) = IUniswapV3PoolState(DAI_WETH).slot0();
        (uint160 sqrtPriceX96USDC,,,,,,) = IUniswapV3PoolState(USDC_WETH).slot0();

        console2.log("sqrtPriceX96DAI: %s", sqrtPriceX96DAI);
        console2.log("sqrtPriceX96USDC: %s", sqrtPriceX96USDC);
    }
}
```

Output:
```bash
Ran 1 test for test/DecimalsPoC.t.sol:DecimalsPoC
[PASS] test_slot0PoC() (gas: 20679)

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 3.30s (2.78s CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 4.45s (3.30s CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

As can be observed from the logs, there is a significant difference in the sqrt price that would be translated into a large tick difference between these two token ratios.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Any difference in decimals between the bond and stablecoin should be factored into the calculation of the sqrt price after unscaling by WAD and before rescaling by `2**(96*2)`.

**Bacon Labs:** Acknowledged, we’re okay with assuming that the bond & the stablecoin will have the same decimals.

**Cyfrin:** Acknowledged.
