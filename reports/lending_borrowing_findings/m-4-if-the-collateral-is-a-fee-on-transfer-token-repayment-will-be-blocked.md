## Vulnerability Title

M-4: If the collateral is a fee-on-transfer token, repayment will be blocked

### Overview


This bug report is about an issue that occurs when the collateral is a fee-on-transfer token. The issue is that when the borrower repays the loan, the amount of collateral withdrawn will be insufficient, causing tx revert. This is because the balance of the collateral in the CollateralEscrowV1 contract is less than the amount to be withdrawn. This issue blocks the user's repayment, causing the loan to be liquidated and the liquidator will not succeed by calling `TellerV2.liquidateLoanFull`. 

The issue is due to the fact that the amount of collateral recorded by the CollateralEscrowV1 contract is equal to the amount originally submitted by the user, which is not enough to cover the fees when transferring token. Two ways to fix this issue are suggested, which are the `afterBalance-beforeBalance` method should be used when recording the amount of collateral and the `transfer` function should be replaced by `transferFrom` in the `CollateralEscrowV1` contract.

The issue was found by a group of auditors, which includes 0x2e, 8olidity, BAHOZ, Bauer, Breeje, Delvir0, HexHackers, HonorLt, MiloTruck, Nyx, Vagner, \_\_141345\_\_, ak1, cccz, cducrest-brainbot, ck, ctf\_sec, dacian, deadrxsezzz, dingo, duc, evmboi32, giovannidisiena, innertia, monrel, n33k, nobody2018, saidam017, shaka, sinarette, spyrosonic10, tsvetanovv, tvdung94, whiteh4t9527, yixxas. The issue was found by manual review and the code snippets are provided in the report.

The issue was discussed and the escalation for 10 USDC was accepted. It was confirmed that this issue is a valid medium as fee-on-transfer tokens are in scope. A Github PR was made to fix the issue and the fix looks good. Repaying a loan in full no longer forces withdrawing collateral, preventing the repay call from reverting.

## Summary

As we all know, some tokens will deduct fees when transferring token. In this way, **the actual amount of token received by the receiver will be less than the amount sent**. If the collateral is this type of token, the amount of collateral recorded in the contract will bigger than the actual amount. **When the borrower repays the loan, the amount of collateral withdrawn will be insufficient, causing tx revert**.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_bidCollaterals` mapping of `CollateralManager` records the `CollateralInfo` of each bidId. This structure records the collateral information provided by the user when creating a bid for a loan. A lender can accept a loan by calling  `TellerV2.lenderAcceptBid` that will eventually transfer the user's collateral from the user address to the CollateralEscrowV1 contract corresponding to the loan. The whole process will deduct fee twice.

```solidity
//CollateralManager.sol
function _deposit(uint256 _bidId, Collateral memory collateralInfo)
        internal
        virtual
    {
        ......
        // Pull collateral from borrower & deposit into escrow
        if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(	//transferFrom first time
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(		//transferFrom second time
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,			//this value is from user's input
                0
            );
        }
        ......
    }
```

The amount of collateral recorded by the CollateralEscrowV1 contract is equal to the amount originally submitted by the user.

When the borrower repays the loan, `collateralManager.withdraw` will be triggered. This function internally calls `CollateralEscrowV1.withdraw`. Since the balance of the collateral in the CollateralEscrowV1 contract is less than the amount to be withdrawn, the entire transaction reverts.

```solidity
//CollateralEscrowV1.sol
function _withdrawCollateral(
        Collateral memory _collateral,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _recipient
    ) internal {
        // Withdraw ERC20
        if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(   //revert
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount	//_collateral.balanceOf(address(this)) < _collateral._amount
            );
        }
    ......
    }
```

## Impact

The borrower's collateral is stuck in the instance of CollateralEscrowV1. Non-professional users will never know that they need to manually transfer some collateral into CollateralEscrowV1 to successfully repay.

- This issue blocked the user's repayment, causing the loan to be liquidated.
- The liquidator will not succeed by calling `TellerV2.liquidateLoanFull`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Two ways to fix this issue.

- The `afterBalance-beforeBalance` method should be used when recording the amount of collateral.

## Discussion

**ethereumdegen**

This is the same as the issue that I explained in the readme for this contest about 'poisoned collateral'. It has been known previously that collateral in the escrow could be made non-transferrable which makes loan repayment impossible. Thank you for the report.  Thisis a re-iteration of what was stated as 'known issues' in the contest readme. 

**iamjakethehuman**

Escalate for 10 USDC 
Disagree with sponsor's comment. This is not the case described in the Readme. The Readme states:
> A: Known issue 1: Collateral assets that can be 'paused' for transfer do exhibit a risk since they may not be able to be withdrawn from the loans as collateral. Furthermore, collateral assets that can be made non-transferrable can actually 'poison' a collateral vault and make a loan non-liquidateable since a liquidateLoan call would revert.

The contest FAQ states:
> FEE-ON-TRANSFER: any

The project clearly hasn't implemented logic for fee-on-transfer tokens when it has clearly stated that it should be able to operate with such tokens.
Would love to hear judge's opinion on this.

You've created a valid escalation for 10 USDC!

To remove the escalation from consideration: Delete your comment.

You may delete or edit your escalation comment anytime before the 48-hour escalation window closes. After that, the escalation becomes final.

**securitygrid**

According to README.md:
Collateral should not be able to be permanently locked/burned in the contracts. 
So this issue is valid M.

**Love4codes**

yeah, i second it's a valid M.
Let's see the judges opinion tho
