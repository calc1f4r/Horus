## Vulnerability Title

Lack of contract existence check on delegatecall will result in unexpected behavior

### Overview


This bug report is about the RocketMinipool contract, which uses the delegatecall proxy pattern. If the implementation contract is incorrectly set or is self-destructed, the contract may not detect failed executions and will return success even though no code was executed. This can be exploited by Eve to scam users.

In order to address this issue, it is recommended to implement a contract existence check before a delegatecall and document the fact that suicide and selfdestruct can lead to unexpected behavior, and prevent future upgrades from introducing these functions. In the long term, it is recommended to carefully review the Solidity documentation, especially the “Warnings” section, and the pitfalls of using the delegatecall proxy pattern.

### Original Finding Content

## Diﬃculty: High

## Type: Access Controls

## Description

The RocketMinipool contract uses the delegatecall proxy pattern. If the implementation contract is incorrectly set or is self-destructed, the contract may not detect failed executions.

The RocketMinipool contract implements a payable fallback function that is invoked when contract calls are executed. This function does not have a contract existence check:

```solidity
fallback(bytes calldata _input) external payable returns (bytes memory) {
    // If useLatestDelegate is set, use the latest delegate contract
    address delegateContract = useLatestDelegate ?
        getContractAddress("rocketMinipoolDelegate") : rocketMinipoolDelegate;
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = delegateContract.delegatecall(_input);
    if (!success) { revert(getRevertMessage(data)); }
    return data;
}
```
*Figure 5.1: RocketMinipool.sol#L102-L108*

The constructor of the RocketMinipool contract also uses the delegatecall function without performing a contract existence check:

```solidity
constructor(RocketStorageInterface _rocketStorageAddress, address _nodeAddress,
            MinipoolDeposit _depositType) {
    [...]
    (bool success, bytes memory data) =
        getContractAddress("rocketMinipoolDelegate").delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature('initialise(address,uint8)', _nodeAddress, uint8(_depositType)));
    if (!success) { revert(getRevertMessage(data)); }
}
```
*Figure 5.2: RocketMinipool.sol#L30-L43*

A delegatecall to a destructed contract will return success as part of the EVM specification. The Solidity documentation includes the following warning:

> The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.

*Figure 5.3: A snippet of the Solidity documentation detailing unexpected behavior related to delegatecall*

The contract will not throw an error if its implementation is incorrectly set or self-destructed. It will instead return success even though no code was executed.

## Exploit Scenario

Eve upgrades the RocketMinipool contract to point to an incorrect new implementation. As a result, each delegatecall returns success without changing the state or executing code. Eve uses this failure to scam users.

## Recommendations

Short term, implement a contract existence check before a delegatecall. Document the fact that suicide and selfdestruct can lead to unexpected behavior, and prevent future upgrades from introducing these functions.

Long term, carefully review the Solidity documentation, especially the “Warnings” section, and the pitfalls of using the delegatecall proxy pattern.
