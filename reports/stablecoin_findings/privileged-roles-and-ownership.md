## Vulnerability Title

Privileged Roles and Ownership

### Overview


This bug report highlights concerns with the functionality and security of the Ethena protocol. The report mentions that the protocol's hedging strategy may not function properly during market turmoil, which could prevent users from redeeming their full balance. Additionally, the report identifies several privileged roles within the system that have the ability to manipulate or misuse funds. For example, the owner role can transfer assets to any address and the Gatekeeper role can remove the Minter role from an address. The report recommends implementing measures to increase transparency and separation of roles to improve the safety of user funds.

### Original Finding Content

**Update**
Marked as "Acknowledged" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> By design, Ethena has admin privileges. However more detailed documentation will be

**File(s) affected:**`EthenaMinting.sol`, `StakedUSDeV2.sol`

**Description:** The proper functioning of the protocol heavily depends on the protocol's hedging strategy. In case of market turmoil, it is possible that the protocol cannot liquidate funds from centralized exchanges, so users might not be able to redeem their full balance. Furthermore, to facilitate users redeeming tokens for their USDe, the protocol admin must first transfer enough funds from the custody back into the Ethena Minting contract. There is no on-chain guarantee that USDe will be redeemable as the team can simply choose not to return the funds. Below we list all the privileged roles in the system.

1.   `EthenaMinting`
    1.   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`
        1.   Can set the `maxMintPerBlock`.
        2.   Can set the `maxRedeemPerBlock`.
        3.   Can add and remove addresses from other roles (excluding `owner`).

    2.   `owner`
        1.   Can set the USDe token address.
        2.   Can add and remove supported assets.

    3.   `MINTER_ROLE`
        1.   Can mint stablecoins from assets.
        2.   **Can transfer any asset in the contract to any address.**

    4.   `REDEEMER_ROLE`
        1.   Can redeem stablecoins for assets.

    5.   `GATEKEEPER_ROLE`
        1.   Can disable minting and redeeming.
        2.   Can remove the `MINTER_ROLE` from an address.

2.   `StakedUSDeV2.sol`
    1.   `owner/DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`
        1.   **Can add and remove addresses from other roles. This should be the role of the Gatekeeper according to documentation.**
        2.   **Can redistribute stUSDe from wallets with the `FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE` to any unrestricted address.**

    2.   `REWARDER_ROLE`
        1.   Can add vested USDe tokens to the contract via `transferInRewards()`.

In the current state of the system, privileged roles can perform various actions that would be detrimental to the health of USDe. Most notably, the following capabilities could be problematic:

1.   The price of an order is not considered on-chain, which means that Ethena Labs could mint any amount of USDe without providing an equal amount of underlying tokens or redeem a small amount of USDe for all of the underlying assets.
2.   The underlying assets backing USDe can be withdrawn from the minting contract to any address.
3.   stUSDe tokens can be seized at any time by the admin role of the staking contract. There should be a separation of roles between assigning the fully restricted role and redistributing their tokens.
4.   Profits from the underlying assets intended for stUSDe holders need to be manually deposited.

**Recommendation:** Consider taking steps to make each part of the process more transparent and traceable for users. This would include extensive user-facing documentation, dashboards showing the value of the underlying assets along with their associated centralized positions, greater separation of roles, and whitelisted addresses that are approved to custody the underlying assets.
