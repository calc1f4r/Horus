## Vulnerability Title

Lack of two-step process for critical operations

### Overview


This bug report is about auditing and logging in the ForceDAO/contracts/* and Cyclical/contracts/*. It is classified as low difficulty. 

The report explains that the critical operations are executed in one function call. The schema is error-prone and can lead to irrevocable mistakes. An example is provided of the blackSmithTeam variable being set on the deployment of the Vault contract. This address can perform privileged operations like pausing the Vault and changing flash loan fees. 

To change the address of the blackSmithTeam contract owner, the owner must call transferToNewTeam. However, if the address is incorrect, the new address will take on the functionality of the new role. To prevent this, a two-step process would be similar to the approve-transferFrom functionality. 

The report provides a potential exploit scenario. Alice deploys a new version of the multisig wallet for the Blacksmith team address. When she invokes the transferToNewTeam function to replace the address, she accidentally enters the wrong address. The new address is granted immediate access to the role and it is too late to revert the action. 

The report provides short term and long term recommendations. Short term, use a two-step process for all non-recoverable critical operations to prevent irrevocable mistakes. Long term, identify and document all possible actions that can be taken by privileged accounts and their associated risks. This will facilitate reviews of the codebase and prevent future mistakes.

### Original Finding Content

## Auditing and Logging

**Type:** Auditing and Logging  
**Target:** ForceDAO/contracts/*, Cyclical/contracts/*  

**Difficulty:** Low  

## Description
Critical operations are executed in one function call. This schema is error-prone and can lead to irrevocable mistakes. For example, the `blackSmithTeam` variable is set on the deployment of the `Vault` contract. This address can perform the privileged operations of pausing the Vault and changing flash loan fees.

```solidity
function initialize(uint256 _flashLoanRate, address _blackSmithTeam)
external
initializer
{
    require(_blackSmithTeam != address(0), "INVALID_TEAM");
    flashLoanRate = _flashLoanRate;
    blackSmithTeam = _blackSmithTeam;
}
```
*Figure 23.1: blacksmith/contracts/Vault.sol#L41-L48*

To change the address of the `blackSmithTeam` contract owner, the owner must call `transferToNewTeam`:

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer control from current team address to another
/// @param _newTeam The new team
function transferToNewTeam(address _newTeam) external onlyBlacksmithTeam {
    require(_newTeam != address(0), "INVALID_NEW_TEAM");
    blackSmithTeam = _newTeam;
    emit TransferControl(_newTeam);
}
```
*Figure 23.2: blacksmith/contracts/Vault.sol#L271-L277*

If the address is incorrect, the new address will immediately take on the functionality of the new role. However, a two-step process would be similar to the `approve-transferFrom` functionality: the contract would approve a new address for a new role, and the new address would acquire the role by calling the contract.

The following functions would benefit from this two-step process:
- `blacksmith/contracts/util/Ownable.sol` — `transferOwnership`
- `polkastrategies/contracts/strategies/{ForceSC.sol, ForceSLP.sol, HarvestDAI.sol, SushiETHSLP.sol}` — `setTreasury`

## Exploit Scenario
Alice deploys a new version of a multisig wallet for the Blacksmith team address. When she invokes the `transferToNewTeam` function to replace the address, she accidentally enters the wrong address. The new address is granted immediate access to the role, and it is too late to revert the action.

## Recommendations
**Short term:** Use a two-step process for all non-recoverable critical operations to prevent irrevocable mistakes.

**Long term:** Identify and document all possible actions that can be taken by privileged accounts and their associated risks. This will facilitate reviews of the codebase and prevent future mistakes.
