## Vulnerability Title

Reminder to use USD feeds and not USDC to avoid Depeg Risk 

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content

## Context: BAMM.sol#L222

**Description:** While the comment found at BAMM.sol#L222 is most likely a typo, it is worth re-iterating that feeds denominated in USDC can be prone to fluctuations that wouldn't happen to USD-denominated feeds. From backtesting the USDC depeg, the worst difference was 13%, which can create strong incentives for Value Extraction as well as potentially create an incentive to lever up to the max, and swap the token while letting the position become under-collateralized.

**Recommendation:** Make sure all feeds are denominated in USD and not USDC.
