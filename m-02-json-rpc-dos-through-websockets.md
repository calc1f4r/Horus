## Vulnerability Title

[M-02] JSON-RPC DoS through Websockets

### Overview


The bug report states that the Websocket service for Zetachain has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to take down the JSON RPC server by sending in malicious messages with a total size of 32MB. This is three times bigger than what is accepted by default for HTTP services and there is no rate limiting in place for Websockets. The report provides details on how the vulnerability can be exploited and recommends mitigation steps, such as limiting the size of messages and implementing a rate-limiting mechanism. The severity of the bug has been decreased to Medium as the vulnerability only causes a denial of service and does not directly lead to a loss of funds. 

### Original Finding Content


The Websocket service accepts messages for 32MB size.

*File: [repos\node\rpc\websockets.go](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-zetachain/blob/b237708ed5e86f12c4bddabddfd42f001e81941a/repos/node/rpc/websockets.go#L50C1-L50C1)*

```go
const (
	messageSizeLimit = 32 * 1024 * 1024 // 32MB

)
(...)
conn.SetReadLimit(messageSizeLimit)
```

This size is 3 times bigger than what Golang accepts by default (10MB) on the HTTP service, while there is no reason that websocket payloads are bigger than HTTP payloads. In addition, there is no rate limiting within the code for the websockets.

As a consequence, an external attacker can **take down** the JSON RPC server by :

*   Opening a websocket RPC Connection to Zetachain through Websockets.
*   Sending in loop, with parallel workers, malicious Websockets messages (with an unknown method) and a total message size of 32MB.

### Details

When the WebSocket server runs, it listens to the messages with `readLoop()` (L211).

When a message is received, the message body is put in `mb` variable. (L222)

This content will then be used to instance a **msg** variable.

*File: [repos\node\rpc\websockets.go](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-zetachain/blob/b237708ed5e86f12c4bddabddfd42f001e81941a/repos/node/rpc/websockets.go#L222)*

```go
_, mb, err := wsConn.ReadMessage()
(...)
var msg map[string]interface{}
		if err = json.Unmarshal(mb, &msg); err != nil {
			s.sendErrResponse(wsConn, err.Error())
			continue
		}
```

Afterwards, some other variables are defined:

*   **method** - msg\["method"]
*   **id** - msg\["id"]

Depending on the "method", a switch case will determine the execution path.
If the method is unknown, a call is done to `tcpGetAndSendResponse()`:

*File: [repos\node\rpc\websockets.go](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-zetachain/blob/b237708ed5e86f12c4bddabddfd42f001e81941a/repos/node/rpc/websockets.go#L319)*

```go
		default:
			// otherwise, call the usual rpc server to respond
			if err := s.tcpGetAndSendResponse(wsConn, mb); err != nil {
				s.sendErrResponse(wsConn, err.Error())
			}
		}

```

This `tcpGetAndSendResponse` function will call the RPC, locally with HTTP:

*File: [repos\node\rpc\websockets.go](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-zetachain/blob/b237708ed5e86f12c4bddabddfd42f001e81941a/repos/node/rpc/websockets.go#L344)*

```go
func (s *websocketsServer) tcpGetAndSendResponse(wsConn *wsConn, mb []byte) error {
	req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(context.Background(), "POST", "http://"+s.rpcAddr, bytes.NewBuffer(mb))
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "Could not build request")
	}
```

However, this function does not perform any sanitation check.
If an attacker sends a 32Mb message on Websockets, **it will internally forward the call to the HTTP server with 32Mb payload**.

### Proof of Concept

A PoC was developed to exploit the vulnerability with :

*   14MB incorrect method name eth_XYZ where XYZ is a random 14MB string,

    The interest in using this function is that the server will attempt to send back the name of the method that was not found, sending therefore an extra 14MB back to the client.

*   14MB payload (random string)

*   Only non-ASCII characters in the payload since it seems to cause more problems on the server upon decoding.

*   30 workers from a single machine

The PoC can be found here : <https://gist.github.com/0xfadam/2846ee14d67ea95741f27e50570ac77a>

The PoC can be launch with the following commands:

```
go mod init poc
go mod tidy
go run poc.go -ip 127.0.0.1 -ws-port 9546 -secure=false -workers 30
```

A video showing the crash of the server after exploitation can be found below :

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The Zetachain server needs to:

*   Limit the size of each message. It should be the same what is configured for HTTP (10 MB)
*   Enforce an applicative rate-limit mechanism so a single client cannot send thousands of messages within a short timeframe.
