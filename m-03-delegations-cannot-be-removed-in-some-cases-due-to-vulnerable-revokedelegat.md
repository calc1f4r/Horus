## Vulnerability Title

[M-03] Delegations cannot be removed in some cases due to vulnerable `revokeDelegate()` implementation

### Overview


This report discusses a bug in the Delegate.Cash protocol that allows an old borrower to use an old delegation to claim on behalf of a new borrower. The problem arises when a borrower delegates locked collateral NFT through `delegateRegistry` to prove token ownership and claim airdrops, event ticketing, etc. Currently, the `MultiSourceLoan::delegate` function allows a borrower to configure custom rights to `delegateERC721`, but the `MultiSourceLoan::revokeDelegate` function does not allow passing `bytes32 _rights` into `delegateERC721()` to correctly revoke existing delegations with custom rights. This means that when a borrower tries to remove the delegation, the old delegation is not cleared and the old borrower can still claim on behalf of the new borrower. The recommended mitigation step is to update the `revokeDelegate()` function to allow passing `bytes32 _rights` to properly revoke the delegation. This bug has been confirmed by 0xend (Gondi) and commented on by 0xsomeone (judge) who has given it a medium-risk severity rating.

### Original Finding Content

An old borrower can use an old delegation to claim on behalf of a new borrower.

### Proof of Concept

A borrower can delegate locked collateral NFT through `delegateRegistry` to prove token ownership and claim airdrops, event ticketing, etc.

[`delegateRegistry`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000000447e69651d841bD8D104Bed493#code) by Delegate.Cash protocol allows custom rights to be configured to a delegatee.

Currently, `MultiSourceLoan::delegate` allows a borrower to configure `bytes32 _rights` to `delegateERC721`. In `DelegateRegistry::delegateERC721`, `bytes32 rights` will be [hashed as part of the key](https://github.com/delegatexyz/delegate-registry/blob/ce89e65f9364db21fc621e247a829d9c08374b4e/src/DelegateRegistry.sol#L83) to store delegation data.

```solidity
//src/lib/loans/MultiSourceLoan.sol
    function delegate(uint256 _loanId, Loan calldata loan, address _delegate, bytes32 _rights, bool _value) external {
        if (loan.hash() != _loans[_loanId]) {
            revert InvalidLoanError(_loanId);
        }
        if (msg.sender != loan.borrower) {
            revert InvalidCallerError();
        }
        //@audit-info a borrower can pass custom rights to delegateERC721
|>      IDelegateRegistry(getDelegateRegistry).delegateERC721(
            _delegate, loan.nftCollateralAddress, loan.nftCollateralTokenId, _rights, _value
        );

        emit Delegated(_loanId, _delegate, _value);
    }
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-gondi/blob/ab1411814ca9323c5d427739f5771d3907dbea31/src/lib/loans/MultiSourceLoan.sol#L484

The problem is, in `MultiSourceLoan::revokeDelegate`, empty rights will always be passed to `delegateERC721`. This means when a borrower configures custom rights in `delegate()`, they cannot remove the delegation. In `DelegateRegistry::delegateERC721`, empty rights will be hashed into a different key from the borrower's actual delegation. [Incorrect delegation data will be read](https://github.com/delegatexyz/delegate-registry/blob/ce89e65f9364db21fc621e247a829d9c08374b4e/src/DelegateRegistry.sol#L83-L85) and `delegateERC721` call will return with no change.

```solidity
//src/lib/loans/MultiSourceLoan.sol
    function revokeDelegate(address _delegate, address _collection, uint256 _tokenId) external {
        if (ERC721(_collection).ownerOf(_tokenId) == address(this)) {
            revert InvalidMethodError();
        }
        //@audit revokeDelegate will always pass empty rights.
|>      IDelegateRegistry(getDelegateRegistry).delegateERC721(_delegate, _collection, _tokenId, "", false);

        emit RevokeDelegate(_delegate, _collection, _tokenId);
    }
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-gondi/blob/ab1411814ca9323c5d427739f5771d3907dbea31/src/lib/loans/MultiSourceLoan.sol#L496

**POC:**

1. The original borrower set custom rights and delegated their collateral NFT to a custom contract.
2. The original borrower's loan ended and NFT is transferred to a new borrower.
3. The protocol or the new borrower calls `revokeDelegate()` to remove previous delegations of the NFT.
4. The new borrower takes out a loan with the NFT and calls `delegate()`, delegating the NFT to a hot wallet.
5. The original borrower's old delegation is not cleared from `delegateRegistry` and still claims an event ticket using the old delegation. The old borrower claims the new borrower's ticket.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `revokeDelegate()`, allow passing `bytes32 _rights` into `delegateERC721()` to correctly revoke existing delegations with custom rights.

### Assessed type

Error

**[0xend (Gondi) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-gondi-findings/issues/2#event-13414538986)**

**[0xsomeone (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-gondi-findings/issues/2#issuecomment-2220217025):**
 > The Warden has outlined how the protocol will incorrectly integrate with the `DelegateRegistry` system, attempting to revoke a previous delegation via an empty payload which is a futile attempt as proper revocation would require the same `_rights` to be passed in with a `false` value for the `_enable` flag.
> 
> I am slightly mixed in relation to this submission as the `MultiSourceLoan::delegate` function can be utilized with a correct payload to remove delegation from the previous user correctly. I believe that users, protocols, etc., will attempt to use the `MultiSourceLoan::revokeDelegate` function to revoke their delegation, and thus, a medium-risk severity rating is appropriate even though a circumvention already exists in the code.
> 
> To note, the code also goes against its `interface` [specification](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-gondi/blob/ab1411814ca9323c5d427739f5771d3907dbea31/src/interfaces/loans/IMultiSourceLoan.sol#L257-L261) further re-inforcing a medium-risk rating level.
