## Vulnerability Title

M-19: curve admin can drain pool via reentrancy (equal to execute emergency withdraw and rug tokenmak fund by third party)

### Overview


This bug report is about an issue identified in Curve Pool liquidity. It was found by ctf_sec and details a vulnerability that allows the Curve admin to drain the pool via reentrancy, which is equivalent to executing an emergency withdrawal and rug tokenmak fund by a third party. This is a problem because the Tokemak protocol does not allow for pausing or emergency withdrawals. A code snippet and Etherscan link were provided to support the report.

The report was discussed in the judging contest channel, where sponsors noted that pausing or emergency withdrawals are not acceptable for Tokemak. The discussion continued in the issue, where JeffCX noted that the risk of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal is not acceptable. Trumpero then agreed with JeffCX's escalation and suggested that the issue be reviewed by codenutt. After some further discussion, codenutt confirmed that the issue is not necessarily related to a particular interaction between Curve and Tokemak, but is instead a general issue with some Curve pools. Trumpero then suggested that the severity of the issue should be marked as medium, and JeffCX agreed, noting that a similar finding was marked as medium.

The escalation was then accepted and the issue was marked as medium and unique.

curve admin can drain pool via reentrancy (equal to execute emergency withdraw and rug tokenmak fund)

## Vulnerability Detail

A few curve liquidity is pool is well in-scope:

```solidity
Curve Pools

Curve stETH/ETH: 0x06325440D014e39736583c165C2963BA99fAf14E
Curve stETH/ETH ng: 0x21E27a5E5513D6e65C4f830167390997aA84843a

Curve swETH/frxETH: 0xe49AdDc2D1A131c6b8145F0EBa1C946B7198e0BA
```

one of the pool is 0x21E27a5E5513D6e65C4f830167390997aA84843a

https://etherscan.io/address/0x21E27a5E5513D6e65C4f830167390997aA84843a#code#L1121

Admin of curve pools can easily drain curve pools via reentrancy or via the `withdraw_admin_fees` function. 

```solidity
@external
def withdraw_admin_fees():
    receiver: address = Factory(self.factory).get_fee_receiver(self)

    amount: uint256 = self.admin_balances[0]
    if amount != 0:
        raw_call(receiver, b"", value=amount)

    amount = self.admin_balances[1]
    if amount != 0:
        assert ERC20(self.coins[1]).transfer(receiver, amount, default_return_value=True)

    self.admin_balances = empty(uint256[N_COINS])
```

if admin of the curve can set a receiver to a malicious smart contract and reenter withdraw_admin_fees a 1000 times to drain the pool even the admin_balances is small

the line of code

```solidty
raw_call(receiver, b"", value=amount)
```

trigger the reentrancy

This is a problem because as stated by the tokemak team:

>> In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
> 
> Pausing or emergency withdrawals are not acceptable for Tokemak.

As you can see above, pausing or emergency withdrawals are not acceptable, and this is possible for cuve pools so this is a valid issue according to the protocol and according to the read me

## Impact

> invalid, as the submission stated: "Admin of curve pools can easily drain curve pools via reentrancy", so no vulnerability for tokemak here 



**JeffCX**

Escalate

as the protocol docs mentioned

https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/101

> In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.

> Pausing or emergency withdrawals are not acceptable for Tokemak.

in the issue got exploit in this report, user from tokenmak lose fund as well

Hi @JeffCX, based on this comment of sponsors in the contest channel, I think this issue should be marked as low/invalid:

**JeffCX**

Sponsor said emergency withdrawal or pause is an unacceptable risk.

Did you read it as "acceptable" sir?

**JeffCX**

Some discussion is happening https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak-judging/issues/899

but this is a separate external integration risk than the balancer one that can impact tokemak user :) and don't think this is a known issue

**Trumpero**

Hello @JeffCX,

Upon further consideration of this matter, I find it to be valid. The potential for the curve admin to exploit the reentrancy-attack and drain the curve pool could have a direct impact on the Tokemak protocol. 

I suggest that you review this issue as well, @codenutt.

Thank you very much! 😄🎉！！

**codenutt**

Thanks @Trumpero / @JeffCX! Just to confirm, this is an issue with some Curve pools just in general, correct? Not necessarily with a particular interaction we have with them.

**Trumpero**

Yes, you are right 

**Evert0x**

Planning to accept escalation and label issue as valid 

**JeffCX**

thanks👍🙏

**Evert0x**

@Trumpero would you agree with high severity?

**Trumpero**

No I think it should be medium since it assume the curve admin become malicious 

**JeffCX**

Agree with medium, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak-judging/issues/570 similar finding about external admin turn into malicious risk is marked as medium as well

**Evert0x**

Result:
Medium
Unique
