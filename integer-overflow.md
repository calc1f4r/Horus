## Vulnerability Title

INTEGER OVERFLOW

### Overview


The `Lord.sol` and `Mead.sol` smart contracts have a bug that could cause an integer overflow. This means that if the total supply of tokens and the amount to be minted are very large numbers, the operation could fail and potentially cause problems with the contracts. This bug can be found in the `mint` function in both contracts. To replicate this issue, you can try to mint a large amount of tokens or increase the limit supply by a large number. The `pentest.js` file also includes code that can cause this bug to occur. The impact of this bug is considered moderate, with a likelihood of it happening also being moderate. The recommendation is to update the contracts with the `SafeMath` library to prevent these overflows from happening. This bug has been solved by the SeaScape Team.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description

The `Lord.sol` and `Mead.sol` smart contracts use an insecure arithmetic operation using the `totalSupply()` and `amount` variables to determine if it is possible to mint that amount. This operation could lead to an integer overflow if the actual supply of tokens and the amount to mint are high numbers.

Code Location
-------------

#### Lord.sol

```
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyBridge {
        require(totalSupply() + amount <= limitSupply, "exceeded mint limit");
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

```

#### Mead.sol

```
    function mint(uint256 _amount, uint8 _v, bytes32 _r, bytes32 _s) external {
        // investor, project verification
        bytes memory prefix     = "\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32";
        bytes32 message         = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, address(this), block.chainid, _amount, mintId, mintNonceOf[msg.sender]));
        bytes32 hash            = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(prefix, message));
        address recover         = ecrecover(hash, _v, _r, _s);

        require(bridges[recover], "sig");

        require(totalSupply() + _amount <= limitSupply, "exceeded mint limit");

        mintNonceOf[msg.sender]++;

        _mint(msg.sender, _amount);
    }

```

to replicate this issue:

* in lord.sol:

  + increase limit supply by any number.
  + try to mint an amount which could cause an overflow, for example '0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffa'.
* in mead.sol:

  + mint a high amount, for example
    '0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffa'.
  + mint again any amount greater than 5 to cause overflow.
* increase limit supply by any number.
* try to mint an amount which could cause an overflow, for example '0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffa'.
* mint a high amount, for example
  '0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffa'.
* mint again any amount greater than 5 to cause overflow.

#### pentest.js

```
    let amount1 = '0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffa';
    let amount2 = '7';

    //..snipped..

    await mead.connect(bridge).mint(amount1, sig.v, sig.r, sig.s);
    await mead.connect(bridge).mint(amount2, sig.v, sig.r, sig.s);

```

#### Output

```
Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside an unchecked block)
    at Mead.mint (contracts/erc20/Mead.sol:78)

```

##### Score

Impact: 3  
Likelihood: 3

##### Recommendation

**SOLVED**: The `SeaScape Team` now implements correctly the `SafeMath` library to avoid these overflows.
