## Vulnerability Title

Forced Use of Claim Accounts for All Relayers in Certain Scenarios

### Overview


The report discusses a bug in the protocol where relayers are forced to use a fallback mechanism for refunds, even if they are able to receive direct refunds. This can lead to issues such as exceeding the compute budget, delays in refunds, increased execution overhead, and potential misuse by malicious actors. The team suggests implementing logic to only use the fallback mechanism for relayers that cannot receive direct refunds, which would optimize operations and improve clarity for users. The bug has been partially resolved, but the team has chosen not to implement the suggested changes due to potential risks and complications. 

### Original Finding Content

When a relayer within a transaction leaf cannot receive direct refunds, such as due to a failed token transfer caused by blacklisting, the protocol uses claim account PDAs to handle the refund. However, this fallback mechanism imposes limitations on other relayers within the same transaction, forcing all of them to claim refunds via a [`ClaimAccount`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/401e24ccca1b3af919dd521e58acd445297b65b6/programs/svm-spoke/src/state/refund_account.rs#L5) PDA, even if direct refunds are possible for them. This leads to the following issues:

* **Risk of Hitting Compute Budget**: The [`accrue_relayer_refunds`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/401e24ccca1b3af919dd521e58acd445297b65b6/programs/svm-spoke/src/instructions/bundle.rs#L219) process involves `find_program_address`, which can be computationally expensive as it iteratively attempts to validate a valid bump. Since this process can be used for several accounts, there is a high likelihood that the transaction will revert. Consequently, relayers and users may not be able to retrieve their refunds from that leaf.
* **Refund Delays**: A relayer might claim their refund from its `ClaimAccount` PDA right before the execution of a leaf, reducing the vault’s total available funds. This could delay refunds for other users as the protocol [might lack sufficient liquidity at the time of execution](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/401e24ccca1b3af919dd521e58acd445297b65b6/programs/svm-spoke/src/instructions/bundle.rs#L142).
* **Increased Execution Overhead**: Executors are responsible for ensuring that all relayers have initialized claim accounts and are incurring additional computational and financial overhead, including the cost of covering rent exemption fees.
* **Liquidity-Related Reverts**: Relayers can [attempt to claim refunds](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/401e24ccca1b3af919dd521e58acd445297b65b6/programs/svm-spoke/src/instructions/refund_claims.rs#L76) when the spoke pool lacks sufficient liquidity. This scenario might result in transaction reversion without providing a meaningful error message, as the hub pool does not track outstanding spoke pool debts.
* **Prone to misuse**: Since the function can be invoked by anyone, malicious actors could front-run the data worker, unnecessarily deferring refunds even when direct refund mechanisms are operational. In addition, a malicious relayer might force the use of claim accounts and delay its refund claim until just before the execution of a leaf, deliberately triggering a revert to disrupt system operations.

Consider implementing logic to route refunds only through `ClaimAccount` PDAs for relayers that are explicitly unable to receive direct transfers. This would optimize operations, prevent errors, and reduce overhead. Moreover, consider enhancing error messaging to clearly indicate insufficient liquidity in the spoke pool during claim attempts. This change would ensure smoother operations and improved clarity for users.

***Update:** Partially resolved in [pull request #847](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/pull/847). The team stated:*

> *We acknowledge the issue and have also considered it extensively when originally working on Solana Spoke program development, but have opted not to introduce suggested changes to full extent due to following reasons: - Risk of Hitting Compute Budget: even when not deferring the refunds, also the `distribute_relayer_refunds` method internally calls `associated_token::get_associated_token_address_with_program_id` that involves calling `find_program_address` to check if valid recipient ATA was provided, so there should not be significant additional cost in `accrue_relayer_refunds` logic compared to `distribute_relayer_refunds`. We have also tested that this can handle up to 28 relayer refund distributions (both to token accounts and claim accounts) that is above the current `MAX_POOL_REBALANCE_LEAF_SIZE` of 25. Even when hitting this limit, the bottleneck was inner instruction size limit when emitting `ExecutedRelayerRefundRoot` event, not the compute budget. This is further confirmed by empirical evidence that each iteration in `find_program_address` consumes additional 1500 compute units, and given the statistical distribution of canonical bump distribution (99.9% take max 10 iterations), even if all 25 refunds were 10 iterations deep (highly unlikely) that would consume 375'000 CU which is still below maximum allowed 1'400'000 limit. - Refund Delays: We don't see how a relayer claiming its deferred refund can negatively affect spoke pool liquidity for the upcoming `execute_relayer_refund_leaf` call compared to scenario if it had received its refund immediately. The proposed pool rebalance within the root bundle should ensure that a spoke should have sufficient liquidity to service relayer refunds, slow fills, cancelled deposits and repayments to HubPool. The only viable scenario where a spoke can have insufficient liquidity is when rebalance tokens are received later than receiving the bridged `relay_root_bundle` call, but that should not be further worsened if relayer refunds get deferred due to some token accounts being blocked. The protocol is designed to be resilient to insufficient liquidity on executing relayer refunds and this happens often on EVM chains due to token bridge and message bridge timing being off. It simply delays how long it takes to refund relayers until the tokens arrive at the target spoke pool. - Increased Execution Overhead: claim account initialization can be automated and the rent exemption fees are recovered when claiming the refund. The proposed fix also optimizes refund claim related instructions by moving parameters to accounts so to benefit from compression of transaction compilation (accounts in multiple instructions might use index references to the same account). This allows claiming up to 21 refunds in one transaction when batching the claim instructions. - Liquidity-Related Reverts: We don't see the necessity to introduce additional vault balance checks when claiming accrued refunds as the default `TokenError::InsufficientFunds` error from the token program should be sufficiently clear. - Prone to misuse: We acknowledge that in the worst case the data worker can fall back to initializing claim accounts, executing deferred refunds and claiming on behalf of all relayers that can receive the refunds to their token accounts. This can further be mitigated by specification in UMIP that refunds have to be sorted by value in the leafs, so that the data worker can opt not to execute leaves for low value refunds that hold larger risk of griefing attacks. - Consider implementing logic to route refunds only through `ClaimAccount` PDAs for relayers that are explicitly unable to receive direct transfers: We originally attempted to implement such selective logic, but the lack of try-catch pattern on transfer CPIs in Solana did not allow to do this efficiently. As an alternative, we considered to duplicate the same checks as in token program transfer instruction to catch a case where a refund to token account might get blocked, but viewed that as introducing too much overhead that could be even further complicated when dealing with Token-2022 program extensions that might block a transfer. Considering above we have opted to apply only a limited fix by optimizing the way how relayer refund claim instructions are composed by moving its parameters to account data that should reduce execution overhead when claiming relayer refunds.*
