## Vulnerability Title

Lack of input validation

### Overview


This bug report is about a codebase that lacks sufficient input validation. Specifically, the `AcceleratingDistributor` contract's `enableStaking` function allows the contract owner to configure several parameters associated with a `stakedToken`, but several of these parameters have no input checking. 

For example, the `maxMultiplier` parameter has no upper or lower bound, and should be restricted to being larger than the “base multiplier” of `1e18` or else it can lead to users’ staking rewards decreasing over time rather than increasing. It should also have an upper bound, because if it were to be set to some very large value it could cause the `getUserRewardMultiplier` function to revert on overflow. This could, in turn, cause calls to the `getOutstandingRewards` and `_updateReward` functions to revert, interfering with the normal operation of the system. 

Similarly, the `secondsToMaxMultiplier` parameter has no lower bound. If allowed to be zero then `getUserRewardMultiplier` could revert due to division by zero. This could cause the `getOutstandingRewards` and `_updateReward` functions to revert as outlined above. 

The `baseEmissionRate` parameter has no upper bound. If set too high then, as soon as `stakingToken.cumulativeStaked` were some non-zero value, the `baseRewardPerToken` function would always revert due to an overflow. This would cause the `_updateReward` to revert even in the case that the provided account was the zero address.

To avoid errors and unexpected system behavior, consider implementing `require` statements to validate all user-controlled input. The bug has been fixed as of commit `9652a990a14d00e4d47f9e4f3df2c422a6881d4a` in pull request #6 and commit `3a4a6382b88f40fa9d816e5e5b1d3a31a7b24f27` in pull request #20.

### Original Finding Content

The codebase generally lacks sufficient input validation.


In the [`AcceleratingDistributor`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol) contract, the [`enableStaking`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L93) function allows the contract owner to configure several parameters associated with a `stakedToken`. Several of these parameters have no input checking. Specifically:


* The [`maxMultiplier`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L97) parameter has no upper or lower bound.
* It should be restricted to being larger than the “base multiplier” of `1e18`, or else it can lead to users’ staking rewards decreasing over time rather than increasing.
* It should also have an upper bound, because if it were to be set to some very large value it could cause the [`getUserRewardMultiplier`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L261) function to [revert on overflow](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L269). This could, in turn, cause calls to the [`getOutstandingRewards`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L279) and [`_updateReward`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L325) functions to revert. This would interfere with the normal operation of the system. However, it could be fixed by the contract owner using the `enableStaking` function to update to a more reasonable `maxMultiplier`.
* Similarly, the [`secondsToMaxMultiplier`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L98) parameter has no lower bound. If allowed to be zero then `getUserRewardMultiplier` could revert due to [division by zero](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L265). This could cause the `getOutstandingRewards` and `_updateReward` functions to revert as outlined above. The contract owner could put the system back into a stable state by making `secondsToMaxMultiplier` non-zero.
* The [`baseEmissionRate`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L96) parameter has no upper bound. If set too high then, as soon as `stakingToken.cumulativeStaked` were some non-zero value, the [`baseRewardPerToken`](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L243) function would always revert [due to an overflow](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/42130387f81debf2a20d2f7b40d9f0ccc1dcd06a/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol#L249). Importantly, this value could be set to a system destabilizing value even when `stakingToken.cumulativeStaked` was already non-zero. This would cause `_updateReward` to revert even in the case that the provided account was the zero address. This detail would prevent the contract owner from fixing the situation without a complete redeployment of the system if any `stakedToken` at all were actively being staked. Any `stakedToken` already in the contract would be locked.


To avoid errors and unexpected system behavior, consider implementing `require` statements to validate *all* user-controlled input.


***Update:** Fixed as of commit `9652a990a14d00e4d47f9e4f3df2c422a6881d4a` in [pull request #6](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/pull/6) and commit `3a4a6382b88f40fa9d816e5e5b1d3a31a7b24f27` in [pull request #20](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/pull/20).*
