## Vulnerability Title

Fee on transfer tokens will cause users to lose funds

### Overview


This bug report discusses a high-risk issue in a contract that allows for the charging of fees when transferring tokens. This can result in users losing their funds or malicious users being able to steal funds from the contract. The report provides details on how this vulnerability can be exploited and recommends a solution to fix it. The recommended solution involves measuring the contract balance before and after the transfer and using the difference as the amount, while also adding a reentrancy guard to prevent further attacks.

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens, such as USDT, allow for charging a fee any time transfer() or transferFrom() is called. If a contract does not allow for amounts to change after transfers, subsequent transfer operations based on the original amount will revert() due to the contract having an insufficient balance. However, a malicious user could also take advantage of this to steal funds from the pool.

## Vulnerability Details

Let's take a look at the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions. 


```
    function deposit(uint _amount) external {
        TKN.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        updateFor(msg.sender);
        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }
```

```
    /// @notice withdraw tokens from stake
    /// @param _amount the amount to withdraw
    function withdraw(uint _amount) external {
        updateFor(msg.sender);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        TKN.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```
## Impact
1. Alice sends 100 of FEE token to the contract when calling `addToPool()`.
2. FEE token contract takes 10% of the tokens (10 FEE).
3. 90 FEE tokens actually get deposit in contract.
4. `_updatePoolBalance(poolId, pools[poolId].poolBalance + amount);` will equal 100.
5. Attacker then sends 100 FEE tokens to the contract
6. The contract now has 180 FEE tokens but each user has an accounting of 100 FEE.
6. The attacker then tries to redeem his collateral for the full amount 100 FEE tokens.
7. The contract will transfer 100 FEE tokens to Bob taking 10 of Alice's tokens with him.
8. Bob can then deposit back into the pool and repeat this until he drains all of Alice's funds.
9. When Alice attempts to withdraw the transaction will revert due to insufficient funds.

## Tools Used

Manual review.

## Recommended Steps

Measure the contract balance before and after the call to transfer()/transferFrom() and use the difference between the two as the amount, rather than the amount stated

```
    function deposit(uint _amount) external {
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(TKN).balanceOf(address(this));
        TKN.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(TKN).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount = balanceBefore - balanceAfter;
        updateFor(msg.sender);
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
```

Note this implementation is vulnerable to reentrancy so be sure to add a reentrancy guard to this function.
