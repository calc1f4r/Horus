## Vulnerability Title

Admin can change _dcttaxpercent to cause users to permanently lose all staked funds 

### Overview


The updateConfigs() function in Controller.sol allows any admin to change key parameters without any upper limit. This means that a rogue admin could change the _dctTaxPercent to 100%, causing users to lose all their staked GOAT tokens. While this requires admin access, the impact is significant as it could result in permanent loss of user funds. The protocol is designed to prevent such attacks, but the README and FAQ sections do not match up with the actual code. The recommendation is to add a require statement to limit the set tax to some upper limit. The severity level is considered low, but the protocol developers plan to renounce ownership in the future to prevent such attacks. 

### Original Finding Content

## Security Report on Controller.sol#L761

## Context
- **File:** Controller.sol
- **Line:** 761

## Details
The `updateConfigs()` function in `Controller.sol` allows any admin to change key parameters, one of which is `_dctTaxPercent`, without any upper limit. This vulnerability allows a rogue admin to set `_dctTaxPercent` to 100%, potentially causing users to lose all their staked GOAT.

While this issue does require admin access, the impact is substantial, leading to a permanent loss of user funds. The protocol is built to be resilient against such admin attacks, as evidenced by the following statement from the FAQ section of the documentation:

### FAQ Section
**Can anyone steal my staked ETH and GOAT?**  
No one. Neither the pool owner nor the protocol creators. Only YOU can unstake your staked funds. Your funds are stored in the Locker contract and controlled by the Controller contract, which doesn’t contain any function that allows any admin to withdraw funds from the Locker contract.

Additionally, the protocol developer indicated in the README that:
> "We make sure that even the dev team cannot touch users’ locked funds in the Locker contracts."

When staking ETH, the protocol limits the `devTeamPercent_` to a maximum of 5%, demonstrating their intent to restrict admin power and prevent users from losing 100% of their funds due to a rogue admin:

```solidity
require(devTeamPercent_ < 5 * 100, "too much for devTeam");
```

However, this `require` statement is not present when users stake GOAT.

## Impact
The impact of this issue is severe. If a rogue developer alters the tax to 100%, users will lose 100% of their staked GOAT tokens.

## Recommendation
A straightforward fix would be to add a `require` statement in the `updateConfigs()` function to limit the set tax to an upper threshold:

```solidity
function updateConfigs(
    uint[] memory values_
)
external
onlyAdmin
{
    require(values_[0] <= 300, "max 3%");
    _bountyPullEarningPercent = values_[0];
    _maxBooster = values_[1];
    _maxSponsorAdv = values_[2];
    _maxSponsorAfter = values_[3];
    _attackFee = values_[4];
    _maxVoterPercent = values_[5];
    _minAttackerFundRate = values_[6];
    _freezeDurationUnit = values_[7];
    _selfStakeAdvantage = values_[8];
    _profileC.setDefaultSPercentConfig(values_[9]);
    _isPausedAttack = values_[10];
    _profileC.setMinSPercentConfig(values_[11]);
    _dctTaxPercent = values_[12];
    + require(values_[12] <= 1000, "max 10%");
    _minFreezeDuration = values_[13];
    _maxFreezeDuration = values_[14];
    _minStakeETHAmount = values_[15];
    _minStakeDCTAmount = values_[16];
    _minDefenderFund = values_[17];
    emit AdminUpdateConfig(values_);
}
```

## Status Update
The team is planning to fix this issue; however, the severity level should be considered low at this time. They intend to `renounceOwnership()` in the future, limiting the necessity of administrators to the early stages for ensuring proper functionality.

## Judge's Conclusion
The researcher highlighted how the protocol is designed to be resilient against admin attacks and presented a valid issue. Overall, this assessment is deemed to have medium severity.
