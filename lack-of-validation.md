## Vulnerability Title

Lack of validation

### Overview


This bug report is about the lack of input/output validation in the codebase of the Forta Token. In particular, the methods in the `Router` and `ScannerRegistryManaged` contracts do not validate the boolean output when adding or removing elements from the routing table or storage. The `Routed.sol` contract does not validate if the address corresponds to a contract or if it is the zero address. The `FortaStaking` contract does not check if a stake exists before initiating a withdrawal and setting a deadline in storage.

The lack of validation on user-controlled parameters could lead to erroneous or failing transactions that are difficult to debug. To prevent this, input and output validation should be added to the codebase. The team has partially fixed the issue on `85d6bd7518efd3a759789225b7dc07d4c26fa7fd` commit in pull request 53, but the team has decided to ignore the boolean output of the `EnumerableSet.add()` method.

### Original Finding Content

Throughout the codebase, there are places where a proper input/output validation is lacking. In particular:


* In the [`Router` contract](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/router/Router.sol#L14), when [adding](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/router/Router.sol#L44) or [removing](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/router/Router.sol#L46) an element from the routing table, the methods return a boolean to inform the success of the call, but this output is never used or validated by the `Router` contract.
* Similarly to the case from above, in the [`ScannerRegistryManaged` contract](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/scanners/ScannerRegistryManaged.sol#L8), when [adding](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/scanners/ScannerRegistryManaged.sol#L37) or [removing](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/scanners/ScannerRegistryManaged.sol#L39) a manager from storage, its method’s output is never validated.
* In [`Routed.sol`](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/utils/Routed.sol#L7), the variable assignment in lines [13](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/utils/Routed.sol#L13) and [25](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/utils/Routed.sol#L25) are not validating if the address corresponds to a contract or if it is the zero address.
* In the [`FortaStaking` contract](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/staking/FortaStaking.sol#L45) it is possible to [initiate a withdrawal](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/staking/FortaStaking.sol#L224) and [set in storage a deadline](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/staking/FortaStaking.sol#L233) for a inexistent stake, [emit several events](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/staking/FortaStaking.sol#L241-L244) during the process, and [trigger an external hook](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/blob/92d7a7ddd6672a7530a4bfc532d0d697e7f12744/contracts/components/staking/FortaStaking.sol#L246).


A lack of validation on user-controlled parameters may result in erroneous or failing transactions that are difficult to debug. To avoid this, consider adding input and output validation to address the concerns raised above and in any other place when appropriate.


***Update:** Partially fixed on [commit `85d6bd7518efd3a759789225b7dc07d4c26fa7fd` in pull request 53](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-token/pull/53/commits/85d6bd7518efd3a759789225b7dc07d4c26fa7fd). The team has acknowledged the lack of validation but it will not be enforced on all the mentioned places. The team’s response for the issue:*



> *NOTE: ignoring EnumerableSet.add() bool output; We don’t care if already added.*
