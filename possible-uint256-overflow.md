## Vulnerability Title

Possible `uint256` overflow

### Overview


This bug report is about the potential for a uint256 overflow in two lines of code in the Lido-Dao project. The lines of code are located at the following links: https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/5b449b740cddfbef5c107505677e6a576e2c2b69/contracts/0.4.24/nos/NodeOperatorsRegistry.sol#L287 and https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/5b449b740cddfbef5c107505677e6a576e2c2b69/contracts/0.4.24/nos/NodeOperatorsRegistry.sol#L311.

A uint256 overflow occurs when a number is too large to fit in a uint256 data type. This can cause unexpected results and should be avoided. The recommendation to fix this bug is to use SafeMath, which is a library of functions that allows developers to safely perform arithmetic operations on numbers of any size, without the risk of overflow.
