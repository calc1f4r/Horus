## Vulnerability Title

[M-06] _`handleExecuteTransaction` may not working correctly on fee-on-transfer tokens. Moreover, if it is failed, fund may be locked forever.

### Overview


A bug has been found in the BridgeFacet, Executor and ExcessivelySafeCall contracts of the Connext project. The bug is that the `_handleExecuteTransaction` function may not work correctly on fee-on-transfer tokens, as it applies a duplicated fee to the token when executing an arbitrary call message passing request. Furthermore, the Executor contract increases allowance on that token for the target contract in full amount without any fee, which could open a vulnerability to steal dust funds in the contract. Additionally, if the Executor contract attempts to send the full amount without any fee, it will fail as this is not possible due to the fee already being applied. This will always revert, causing a loss of funds in all cases of fee-on-transfer tokens.

Proof of concept was provided, showing that when a message to transfer 100 Safemoon with a contract call payload was submitted to `_handleExecuteTransaction`, the Executor contract had 100 Safemoon transferred to it before the contract execution, but due to the 10% fee on transfer, the Executor contract only had 90 Safemoon. Then, the Executor contract increased allowance of the target contract to transfer 100 more Safemoon, but when the target contract tried to pull 100 Safemoon from the Executor contract, it failed as the Executor contract only had 90 Safemoon. Thus, the failure handle reverted, causing a loss of funds.

The recommended mitigation step is to avoid an extra token transfer and remove support for fee-on-transfer tokens. This was confirmed by LayneHaber (Connext), who acknowledged the deeper problems with fee-on-transfer tokens and resolved the error on fee. Finally, 0xleastwood (judge) decreased the severity to Medium, as the bridge transfer should execute successfully, but the only issue is that if routers front liquidity, they are exposing themselves to receiving slightly less funds due to the fee upon reconciliation.

`_handleExecuteTransaction` may not working correctly on fee-on-transfer tokens. As duplicated fee is applied to fee on transfer token when executing a arbitrary call message passing request. Moreover, the Executor contract increase allowance on that token for that target contract in **full amount without any fee**, this may open a vulnerability to steal dust fund in the contract

Moreover, failure is trying to send **full amount without any fee** which is not possible because fee is already applied one time for example 100 Safemoon -> 90 Safemoon but trying to transfer 100 safemoon to `_recovery address`. Obviously not possible since we only have 90 Safemoon. This will revert and always revert causing loss of fund in all case of fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Proof of Concept

A message to transfer 100 Safemoon with some contract call payload has been submitted by a relayer to `_handleExecuteTransaction` function on BridgeFacet these lines hit.

          // execute calldata w/funds
          AssetLogic.transferAssetFromContract(_asset, address(s.executor), _amount);
          (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = s.executor.execute(
            IExecutor.ExecutorArgs(
              _transferId,
              _amount,
              _args.params.to,
              _args.params.recovery,
              _asset,
              _reconciled
                ? LibCrossDomainProperty.formatDomainAndSenderBytes(_args.params.originDomain, _args.originSender)
                : LibCrossDomainProperty.EMPTY_BYTES,
              _args.params.callData
            )
          );

Noticed that 100 Safemoon is transferred to executor before contract execution. Now executor has 90 Safemoon due to 10% fee on transfer.

        if (!isNative) {
          SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeIncreaseAllowance(IERC20Upgradeable(_args.assetId), _args.to, _args.amount);
        }

Next, we increase allowance of target contract to transfer 100 more Safemoon.

        // Try to execute the callData
        // the low level call will return `false` if its execution reverts
        (success, returnData) = ExcessivelySafeCall.excessivelySafeCall(
          _args.to,
          gas,
          isNative ? _args.amount : 0,
          MAX_COPY,
          _args.callData
        );

After that, it call target contract

        // Try to execute the callData
        // the low level call will return `false` if its execution reverts
        (success, returnData) = ExcessivelySafeCall.excessivelySafeCall(
          _args.to,
          gas,
          isNative ? _args.amount : 0,
          MAX_COPY,
          _args.callData
        );

Target contract tried to pull 100 Safemoon from Executor but now Executor only has 90 Safemoon, so contract call failed. Moving on to the failure handle.

      function _handleFailure(
        bool isNative,
        bool hasIncreased,
        address _assetId,
        address payable _to,
        address payable _recovery,
        uint256 _amount
      ) private {
        if (!isNative) {
          // Decrease allowance
          if (hasIncreased) {
            SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeDecreaseAllowance(IERC20Upgradeable(_assetId), _to, _amount);
          }
          // Transfer funds
          SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransfer(IERC20Upgradeable(_assetId), _recovery, _amount);
        } else {
          // Transfer funds
          AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(_recovery, _amount);
        }
      }

isNative = false because of Safemoon

Trying to transfer 100 Safemoon to \_recovery while only having 90 Safemoon in the contract. Thus failure handle is reverted.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You should approve one step only. Avoid an extra token transfer.

**[LayneHaber (Connext) confirmed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext-findings/issues/196#issuecomment-1166340894):**
 > Not sure I agree with the mitigation (perhaps a better alternative would be to transfer the balance of the executor), but understand the problems!

**[LayneHaber (Connext) acknowledged and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext-findings/issues/196#issuecomment-1166624673):**
 > Upon further reflection, choosing to remove support for fee on transfer tokens. The problems are much deeper than just issues on `execute` -- the minted token will *not* have fees on transfers (uses vanilla ERC20 implementation), and i doubt the `StableSwap` implementations are taking these into account as well. Changing label to "acknowledged"!

**[LayneHaber (Connext) resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext-findings/issues/196#issuecomment-1167496442):**

**[0xleastwood (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext-findings/issues/196#issuecomment-1213567388):**
 > The destination chain will indeed be unable to handle bridge transfers involving fee-on-transfer tokens. Although, its worth adding that this is only made possible because `handleIncomingAsset` and `swapToLocalAssetIfNeeded` in `xcall` do not fail when the provided asset has some fee-on-transfer behaviour.
> 
> Because `_args.amount` is not overridden with the actual `amount` transferred in from `handleIncomingAsset`, routers on the destination chain will attempt to provide liquidity for the amount transferred by the user + the fee. Furthermore, when the transfer has been fully bridged, routers who fronted the liquidity will receive less funds than expected. However, I don't actually think this issue warrants `high` severity, mainly because the bridge transfer should actually execute successfully.
> 
> The only issue is that if routers front liquidity, they are exposing themselves to receiving slightly less funds due to the fee upon reconciliation. Hence, only value is being leaked and I think `medium` severity makes more sense.
