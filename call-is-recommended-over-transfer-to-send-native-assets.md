## Vulnerability Title

Call is recommended over transfer to send native assets

### Overview


The report discusses an issue with the `transfer()` function in the `Gateway` contract, which is used to transfer gas refunds to depositors. The problem is that this function has a fixed gas limit that can cause issues when sending Ether to certain types of wallets. The recommended solution is to use the `call()` function instead, which allows for a custom gas limit. However, this also requires additional measures to prevent reentrancy attacks. The Analog Labs team, who created the contract, states that this issue does not apply to external smart contracts and therefore no remediation plan is needed.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description

The `Gateway` contract performs the gas refunds to the depositors by making use of the Solidity `transfer()` function:

```
// Calculate a gas refund, capped to protect against huge spikes in `tx.gasprice`
// that could drain funds unnecessarily. During these spikes, relayers should back off.
unchecked {
    uint256 refund = BranchlessMath.min(gasUsed * tx.gasprice, deposited);
    _deposits[message.source][message.srcNetwork] -= refund;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(refund); // <-----------------------------------
}
```

In Solidity, the `call()` function is often preferred over `transfer()` for sending Ether In Solidity due to some gas limit considerations:

* `transfer`: **Imposes a fixed gas limit of 2300 gas. This limit can be too restrictive, especially if the receiving contract is a multisig wallet that executes more complex logic in its** `receive()` **function. For example, native** `transfer()`**calls to Gnosis Safe multisigs will always revert with an out-of-gas error in Binance Smart Chain.**
* `call`: Allows specifying a custom gas limit, providing more flexibility and ensuring that the receiving contract can perform necessary operations.

It should be noted that using `call` also requires explicit reentrancy protection mechanisms (e.g., using checks-effects-interactions pattern or the `ReentrancyGuard` contract from OpenZeppelin).

##### Recommendation

Consider using `call()` over `transfer()` to transfer native assets in order to ensure compatibility with any type of multisig wallet. As for the reentrancy risks, these are currently mitigated by the following code in the `Gateway.execute()` function:

```
// Execute GMP message
function _execute(bytes32 payloadHash, GmpMessage calldata message, bytes memory data)
    private
    returns (GmpStatus status, bytes32 result)
{
    // Verify if this GMP message was already executed
    GmpInfo storage gmp = _messages[payloadHash];
    require(gmp.status == GmpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "message already executed");

    // Update status to `pending` to prevent reentrancy attacks.
    gmp.status = GmpStatus.PENDING;
    gmp.blockNumber = uint64(block.number);
	...
}
```

### Remediation Plan

**NOT APPLICABLE:** The **Analog Labs team** states that only their own chronicles will call this function and receive by it and hence it will not be used by and external smart contract.
