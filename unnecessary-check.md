## Vulnerability Title

Unnecessary check

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description
At line https://github.com/lidofinance/aragon-apps/blob/7e5cd1961697a1bc514bfebdeab08a296e51d700/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol#L423 the check is unnecessary since the check at line https://github.com/lidofinance/aragon-apps/blob/7e5cd1961697a1bc514bfebdeab08a296e51d700/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol#L428 returns `true` if the vote is open during the voting time. The vote cannot be executed until the end of the objection time.

##### Recommendation
Remove this check or refactor the `_isVoteOpen()` and `_isVoteOpenForObjection()` logic.
