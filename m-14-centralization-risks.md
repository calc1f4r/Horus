## Vulnerability Title

[M-14] Centralization Risks

### Overview


This bug report is about the centralization risks of the Paraspace protocol. It was submitted by multiple users, and it highlights several issues related to the protocol. 

The first issue is that the calculateAuctionPriceMultiplier() function is not properly implemented and will revert when either _maxPriceMultiplier or _minExpPriceMultiplier is less than 1e18. This causes the executeLiquidateERC721() function not to work, resulting in the protocol losing a lot of money. 

The second issue is that Uniswap v3 LP token might be auctionable. The protocol determines if an asset type can be auctioned by checking if the auctionStrategyAddress is configured. However, there is no mechanism to prevent the admin from configuring the auctionStrategyAddress of the Uniswap v3 LP token, which might result in it being auctionable. 

The third issue is that poolAdmin can withdraw all underlying asset balance of NTokens by using executeAirdrop() function. Each NToken contract holds all the users collaterals for a specific underlying asset, and poolAdmin is the admin of the pool. However, poolAdmin should not be able to withdraw and transfer users funds (the underlying asset). The rescueERC721() function, which is only callable by poolAdmin, has a check that makes sure the admin can't transfer the underlying asset, but this check is not sufficient.

### Original Finding Content


***Note: per discussion with the judge, instead of highlighting only one submission related to centralization risks, all related findings are being compiled together under M-14 to provide a more complete report.***

### [**1. The calculateAuctionPriceMultiplier() function is not properly implemented**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/125)

The `_calculateAuctionPriceMultiplierByTicks()` function is not properly implemented, it will revert when `_maxPriceMultiplier < 1e18` or `_minExpPriceMultiplier < 1e18`, causes `executeLiquidateERC721()` not working. If the owner sets either of these numbers incorrectly, auctions will revert and the protocol will lose a lot of money.

### [**2. Uniswap v3 LP token might be auctionable**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/287)

The protocol determines whether an asset type can be auctioned purely by checking if the `auctionStrategyAddress` is configured. If the `auctionStrategyAddress` of an asset is configured, then it can be auctioned. 

However, upon inspecting the code, it was observed that the initialization function (`ReserveLogic.init`) and `PoolParameters.setReserveAuctionStrategyAddress` do not have any mechanism to prevent the admin from configuring the `auctionStrategyAddress` of the Uniswap v3 LP token. Thus, it is possible that the admin accidentally configures the `auctionStrategyAddress` of the Uniswap v3 LP token, and this results in Uniswap v3 LP token being auctionable.

### [**3. poolAdmin can withdraw all underlying asset balance of NTokens by using executeAirdrop() function**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/211)
*Duplicates: [199](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/199), [234](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/234), [485](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/485), [488](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/488)*

each NToken contract holds all the users collaterals for specific underlying asset. poolAdmin is the admin of the pool and have some accesses but he/she shouldn't be able to withdraw and transfer users funds(the underlying asset). in the functions `rescueERC721()` which is only callable by poolAdmin, there is a check that make sures admin can't transfer underlying asset but in the function `executeAirdrop()` there is no checks. function `executeAirdrop()` make a external call with admin specified address, function, parameters. admin can set parameters so the logic would call `underlyingAsset.safeTransferFrom(NToken, destAdderss, tokenId)` or `underlyingAsset.setApprovalForAll(destAddress, true)` and then admin could transfer all the underlying assets which belongs to users. this is critical issue because all the protocol collaterals are in danger if poolAdmin private key get compromised.

### [**4. A single point of failure can allow a hacked or malicious owner to use critical functions in the project**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/70)
*Duplicates: [248](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/248), [272](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/272), [437](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/437), [477](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/477), [521](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/521)*

The `owner` role has a single point of failure and `onlyOwner` can use a few critical functions.

`owner` role in the paraspace project:<br>
Owner is not behind a multisig and changes are not behind a timelock. There is no clear definition of the `owner` in the paraspace docs.

Even if protocol admins/developers are not malicious there is still a chance for Owner keys to be stolen. In such a case, the attacker can cause serious damage to the project due to important functions. In such a case, users who have invested in project will suffer high financial losses.

### [**5. NFTFloorOracle: setPrice can lead to user nft lost, or protocol drain of funds due to lack of check of constraints established in documentation and code**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/251)
*Duplicates: [29](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/29), [30](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/30), [54](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/54), [59](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/59), [86](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/86), [359](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/359), [375](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/375), [410](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/410), [433](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/433), [437](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/437), [441](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/441), [450](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/450), [473](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/473), [521](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/521)*

-   Centralization risk: Admin can bypass all security measures established in documentation, allowing they to drain all protocol funds if they buy an accepted NFT as collateral and then set it floor price to max value possible
-   Admin can set current TWAP to zero, leading to user lose of NFTs due to liquidation.
-   Allows feeder to eventually inform any price if they set _twap to zero

### [**6. Pool admin can steal underlying of a NToken**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/452)
*Duplicates: [236](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/236), [296](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/296), [437](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/437), [513](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/513)*

The admin can:

- steal ERC20 assets calling rescueERC20() from NToken.sol 
- steal ERC1155 assets calling rescueERC1155() from NToken.sol 
- steal ERC721 assets calling rescueERC721() from NToken.sol 

### [**7. Owner can change implementation of various contracts**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/347)
*Duplicates: [516](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/516)*

The owner can update the implementation of various contracts, allowing theft of assets and general compromise of the protocol.

One example:<br>
The owner of the PoolAddressProvider.sol contract can update the implementation of Pool contract by calling updatePoolImpl function.

The contract provides an easy way to add new functions using IParaProxy.ProxyImplementationAction.Add enum. This way a malicious user can add a malicious function in the Pool contract which can be used to steal tokens from other contracts which rely on the onlyPool modifier for their checks.

### [**8. Owner can renounce while system is paused**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace-findings/issues/521)

The contract owner or single user with a role is not prevented from renouncing the role/ownership while the contract is paused, which would cause any user assets stored in the protocol, to be locked indefinitely
