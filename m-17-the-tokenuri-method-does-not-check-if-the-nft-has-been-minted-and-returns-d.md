## Vulnerability Title

[M-17] The tokenURI method does not check if the NFT has been minted and returns data for the contract that may be a fake NFT

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in the Factory.tokenURI and PrivatePoolMetadata.tokenURI methods of the code-423n4/2023-04-caviar repository. This vulnerability could lead to a poor user experience or financial loss for users, as it allows maliciously provided NFT ids to return data for non-existent NFTs that appear to be genuine PrivatePools. 

The vulnerability was identified through manual review and Foundry tools. The proof of concept involved creating a fake contract, deploying it, and then using the tokenURI method for the deployed user's address to fetch information about a non-existent NFT.

The recommended mitigation step is to throw an error if the NFT id is invalid. This is already present in the standard implementation by OpenZeppelin, and should be implemented in the code-423n4/2023-04-caviar repository as well.

## Vulnerability details

## Impact

- By invoking the [Factory.tokenURI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/cd8a92667bcb6657f70657183769c244d04c015c/src/Factory.sol#L161) method for a maliciously provided NFT id, the returned data may deceive potential users, as the method will return data for a non-existent NFT id that appears to be a genuine PrivatePool. This can lead to a poor user experience or financial loss for users.
- Violation of the [ERC721-Metadata part](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard

## Proof of Concept

- The [Factory.tokenURI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/cd8a92667bcb6657f70657183769c244d04c015c/src/Factory.sol#L161) and [PrivatePoolMetadata.tokenURI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/cd8a92667bcb6657f70657183769c244d04c015c/src/PrivatePoolMetadata.sol#L17) methods lack any requirements stating that the provided NFT id must be created. We can also see that in the standard implementation by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/cf86fd9962701396457e50ab0d6cc78aa29a5ebc/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L94), this check is present:
- [Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)

### Example

1. User creates a fake contract
   A simple example so that the `tokenURI` method does not revert:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract NFT {
    function balanceOf(address) external pure returns (uint256) {
        1;
    }
}

contract NonNFT {
    address public immutable nft;

    address public constant baseToken = address(0);
    uint256 public constant virtualBaseTokenReserves = 1 ether;
    uint256 public constant virtualNftReserves = 1 ether;
    uint256 public constant feeRate = 500;

    constructor() {
        nft = address(new NFT());
    }
}
```

2. User deploy the contract
3. Now, by using `tokenURI()` for the deployed user's address, one can fetch information about a non-existent NFT.

## Tools Used

- Manual review
- Foundry

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

- Throw an error if the NFT id is invalid.
