## Vulnerability Title

Initialization functions can be front-run

### Overview


This bug report is about data validation in the CurveAMO_V3.sol contract. It is a high difficulty issue that can be exploited by an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contracts through front-running the initialization functions. The attacker can set their own address as the _collateral_address value and use tokens that return booleans and do not revert upon failing. 

To solve this issue, the short-term solution is to use hardhat-upgrades to deploy the proxies and implementation contracts. This will provide robust protections against front-running attacks. The long-term solution is to carefully review the Solidity documentation, especially the “Warnings” section, and the pitfalls of using the delegatecall proxy pattern.

### Original Finding Content

## Data Validation
**Target:** CurveAMO_V3.sol

**Difficulty:** High

## Description
Several implementation contracts have initialization functions that can be front-run, allowing an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contracts. Due to the use of the `delegatecall` proxy pattern, many of the contracts cannot be initialized with a constructor and have initializer functions:

```solidity
function initialize(
    address _frax_contract_address,
    address _fxs_contract_address,
    address _collateral_address,
    address _creator_address,
    address _custodian_address,
    address _timelock_address,
    address _frax3crv_metapool_address,
    address _three_pool_address,
    address _three_pool_token_address,
    address _pool_address
) public payable initializer {
    FRAX = FRAXStablecoin(_frax_contract_address);
    fxs_contract_address = _fxs_contract_address;
    collateral_token_address = _collateral_address;
    collateral_token = ERC20(_collateral_address);
    crv_address = 0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52;
    missing_decimals = uint(18).sub(collateral_token.decimals());
    timelock_address = _timelock_address;
    owner_address = _creator_address;
    custodian_address = _custodian_address;
    voter_contract_address = _custodian_address; // Default to the custodian
}
```
*Figure 9.1: contracts/Curve/CurveAMO_V3.sol#L109-L130*

An attacker could front-run these functions and initialize the contracts with malicious values.

## Exploit Scenario
Bob deploys the CurveAMO_V3 contract. Eve front-runs the contract initialization and sets her own address as the `_collateral_address` value. As a result, she can set tokens that return booleans and do not revert upon failing, thereby exploiting the lack of return value checks (TOB-FRAX-001).

## Recommendations
Short term, use `hardhat-upgrades` to deploy the proxies and implementation contracts. This will ensure that deployment scripts have robust protections against front-running attacks.

Long term, carefully review the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org), especially the “Warnings” section, as well as the pitfalls of using the `delegatecall` proxy pattern.
