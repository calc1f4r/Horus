## Vulnerability Title

Initialization functions can be front-run

### Overview


This bug report is about a data validation issue in the openzeppelin-contracts/*/Proxy.sol. It is classified as a medium difficulty issue. The implementation contracts have initialize functions that can be front-run, allowing an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contracts. If the front-running of one of these functions is not detected immediately, an attacker may be able to steal funds at a later time.

The deployment scripts use two separate transactions for the deployment of the proxy contract and the call to initialize. This makes the initialize functions vulnerable to front-running by an attacker, who could then initialize the contracts with malicious values. An example of this is an attacker setting an address that she owns as the _rewards parameter of AaveMarket’s initialize function, which would allow her to earn all rewards that accrue on the Aave money market.

The short-term recommendation is to only deploy TransparentUpgradeableProxy contracts by passing the calldata of the call to initialize as the third constructor argument. This way, initialize will be called within the same transaction as the proxy contract construction, eliminating the front-running vulnerability entirely. The openzeppelin-hardhat-upgrades plug-in can automatically call initialize within the same transaction as the proxy contract construction.

The long-term recommendation is to carefully review the Solidity documentation, especially the “Warnings” section, as well as the pitfalls of using the delegatecall proxy pattern.

### Original Finding Content

## Data Validation

**Type:** Data Validation  
**Target:** openzeppelin-contracts/*/Proxy.sol  

**Difficulty:** Medium  

## Description
Several implementation contracts have initialize functions that can be front-run, allowing an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contracts. If the front-running of one of these functions is not detected immediately, an attacker may be able to steal funds at a later time. 

The deployment scripts use two separate transactions for the deployment of the proxy contract and the call to initialize (figure 7.1).

```javascript
const deployResult = await deploy(poolConfig.name, {
    from: deployer,
    contract: "DInterest",
    proxy: {
        owner: config.govTimelock,
        proxyContract: "OptimizedTransparentProxy"
    }
});

if (deployResult.newlyDeployed) {
    const DInterest = artifacts.require("DInterest");
    const contract = await DInterest.at(deployResult.address);
    await contract.initialize(
        BigNumber(poolConfig.MaxDepositPeriod).toFixed(),
    );
}
```
*Figure 7.1: deploy/DInterest.js#L29-L41*

This makes the initialize functions vulnerable to front-running by an attacker, who could then initialize the contracts with malicious values. For example, an attacker could set an address that she owns as the _rewards parameter of AaveMarket’s initialize function, which would allow her to earn all rewards that accrue on the Aave money market.

## Exploit Scenario
Attacker Eve has studied the next version of the 88mph protocol and identified several parameters of initialization functions that, if set to certain values, will allow her to steal funds from the protocol. She sets up a script to automatically watch the mempool and front-run the initialize functions of the next 88mph protocol deployment. Bob, a developer, deploys the next version of the 88mph protocol. Eve’s script front-runs the calls to initialize. Bob does not notice the front-running attack. Eve can then steal funds deposited into the protocol.

## Recommendations
Short term, only deploy TransparentUpgradeableProxy contracts by passing the calldata of the call to initialize as the third constructor argument (figure 7.2). That way, initialize will be called within the same transaction as the proxy contract construction, eliminating the front-running vulnerability entirely. This is the most robust solution to this issue. The openzeppelin-hardhat-upgrades plug-in can automatically call initialize within the same transaction as the proxy contract construction.

```javascript
constructor(
    address _logic,
    address admin_,
    bytes memory _data
) payable ERC1967Proxy(_logic, _data) {
}
```
*Figure 7.2: openzeppelin-contracts/*/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol#L33-L37*

Long term, carefully review the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/), especially the “Warnings” section, as well as the pitfalls of using the delegatecall proxy pattern.
