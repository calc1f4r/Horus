## Vulnerability Title

Submit Always Returns Zero

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content

## Description

DePool._submit() 19 never assigns to the StETH return variable, so the value returned is always 0. This has no direct security impact on the Lido platform, but may cause problems for contracts that use Lido and expect a non-zero return value upon successful call to submit().

## Recommendations

Modify Lido._submit() such that it returns the amount of stETH minted by the submission, as documented.

## Resolution

This has been resolved in PR #193 such that Lido.submit() now returns the number of shares generated.

19 Defined at v0.1.0-rc.1 DePool.sol:408-431
