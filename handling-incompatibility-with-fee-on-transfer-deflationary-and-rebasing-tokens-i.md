## Vulnerability Title

Handling Incompatibility with Fee-on-Transfer, Deflationary, and Rebasing Tokens in `GatewayManagerFacet`

### Overview


This report discusses a bug in the GatewayManagerFacet contract that affects the fundWithToken function. This function is used to transfer ERC20 tokens between subnets, but it does not account for fees, deflation, or rebasing mechanisms in certain types of tokens. This can result in discrepancies between the specified and actual transferred amounts, potentially leading to errors in accounting and inflation of the token supply. The recommendation is to adjust the fundWithToken workflow to accurately reflect the transferred amount and implement balance checks and adjustments in the minted amount. 

### Original Finding Content

**Severity** - High

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Overview**

The GatewayManagerFacet contract facilitates token funding operations across subnets through its `fundWithToken` function. This function is designed to lock a specified amount of ERC20 tokens from the user's address and mint a corresponding amount in the destination address within a subnet. However, an oversight has been identified when interacting with fee-on-transfer (FoT), deflationary, or rebasing tokens. These token types inherently modify the transfer amount through fees, deflation, or rebasing mechanisms, leading to discrepancies between the specified and actually transferred amounts.

Function Analysis Function: fundWithToken(SubnetID calldata subnetId, FvmAddress calldata to, uint256 amount)

**Purpose:**

To fund a specified address within a subnet with a specified amount of ERC20 tokens. Process: Validates the token's compliance with the ERC20 standard. Locks the specified token amount into custody. Creates and commits a top-down message to mint the equivalent token supply on the destination subnet. Core Issue The primary issue arises from the contract's failure to account for the actual token balance transfer discrepancies in the case of FoT, deflationary, or rebasing tokens. The lock function utilizes safeTransferFrom to move tokens from the user to the contract without accounting for the potential reduction in the transferred amount due to fees or token supply adjustments. 

**Impact**: 

Accounting Errors: The protocol assumes the locked amount matches the specified amount, disregarding the actual amount received. This discrepancy leads to the minting of more tokens on the destination subnet than what is locked in the contract. Integrity of Token Supply: Such inconsistencies can inflate the token supply on the subnet, undermining the token's economic model and potentially affecting its value and user trust. 

**Recommendation**:

l A robust solution involves adjusting the fundWithToken workflow to accurately reflect the transferred token amount post-interaction with FoT, deflationary, or rebasing tokens. The proposal includes: Pre- and Post-Transfer Balance Checks: Implement balance checks before and after the execution of safeTransferFrom within the lock function to determine the actual transferred amount. Adjustment of Minted Amount: Adjust the amount to be minted on the destination subnet based on the actual received amount rather than the initially specified amount.
