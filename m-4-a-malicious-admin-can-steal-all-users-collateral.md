## Vulnerability Title

M-4: A malicious admin can steal all users collateral

### Overview


This bug report is about an attack vector that a malicious admin can use to steal all user collateral. It is found by J4de and KingNFT and is located in the PriceOracleManager.sol file in the taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/PriceOracleManager.sol. This attack vector is possible as the admin (onlyOwner) can update any price oracle _wrapperAddress for any _underlying collateral without any restrictions, such as timelock. This allows the admin to set a malicious price oracle and call the liquidate() function to drain out users collateral with negligible $TAU cost. The impact of this attack vector is that a malicious admin can steal all users collateral. To fix this issue, the update of price oracle should be restricted with a timelock. A discussion was had about this issue and it was decided that this issue should be considered a valid medium.

### Original Finding Content

## Found by 
J4de, KingNFT

## Summary
According to Taurus contest details, all roles, including the admin ````Multisig````, should not be able to drain users collateral.
```solidity
2. Multisig. Trusted with essentially everything but user collateral. 
```
https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/45
But the current implementation allows admin to update price feed without any restriction, such as ````timelock````. This leads to an attack vector that a malicious admin can steal all users collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown of ````updateWrapper()```` function of ````PriceOracleManager.sol````, the admin (````onlyOwner````) can update any price oracle ````_wrapperAddress```` for any ````_underlying```` collateral without any restrictions (such as ````timelock````).
```solidity
File: taurus-contracts\contracts\Oracle\PriceOracleManager.sol
36:     function updateWrapper(address _underlying, address _wrapperAddress) external override onlyOwner {
37:         if (!_wrapperAddress.isContract()) revert notContract();
38:         if (wrapperAddressMap[_underlying] == address(0)) revert wrapperNotRegistered(_wrapperAddress);
39: 
40:         wrapperAddressMap[_underlying] = _wrapperAddress;
41: 
42:         emit WrapperUpdated(_underlying, _wrapperAddress);
43:     }
```
Hence, admin can set a malicious price oracle like 
```solidity
contract AttackOracleWrapper is IOracleWrapper, Ownable {
    address public attacker;
    IGLPManager public glpManager;

    constructor(address _attacker, address glp) {
        attacker = _attacker;
        glpManager = IGLPManager(glp);
    }

    function getExternalPrice(
        address _underlying,
        bytes calldata _flags
    ) external view returns (uint256 price, uint8 decimals, bool success) {
        if (tx.origin == attacker) {
            return (1, 18, true); // @audit a really low price resulting in the liquidation of all positions
        } else {
            uint256 price = glpManager.getPrice();
            return (price, 18, true);
        }
    }
}
```
Then call ````liquidate()```` to drain out users collateral with negligible $TAU cost.
```solidity
File: taurus-contracts\contracts\Vault\BaseVault.sol
342:     function liquidate(
343:         address _account,
344:         uint256 _debtAmount,
345:         uint256 _minExchangeRate
346:     ) external onlyLiquidator whenNotPaused updateReward(_account) returns (bool) {
347:         if (_debtAmount == 0) revert wrongLiquidationAmount();
348: 
349:         UserDetails memory accDetails = userDetails[_account];
350: 
351:         // Since Taurus accounts' debt continuously decreases, liquidators may pass in an arbitrarily large number in order to
352:         // request to liquidate the entire account.
353:         if (_debtAmount > accDetails.debt) {
354:             _debtAmount = accDetails.debt;
355:         }
356: 
357:         // Get total fee charged to the user for this liquidation. Collateral equal to (liquidated taurus debt value * feeMultiplier) will be deducted from the user's account.
358:         // This call reverts if the account is healthy or if the liquidation amount is too large.
359:         (uint256 collateralToLiquidate, uint256 liquidationSurcharge) = _calcLiquidation(
360:             accDetails.collateral,
361:             accDetails.debt,
362:             _debtAmount
363:         );
364: 
365:         // Check that collateral received is sufficient for liquidator
366:         uint256 collateralToLiquidator = collateralToLiquidate - liquidationSurcharge;
367:         if (collateralToLiquidator < (_debtAmount * _minExchangeRate) / Constants.PRECISION) {
368:             revert insufficientCollateralLiquidated(_debtAmount, collateralToLiquidator);
369:         }
370: 
371:         // Update user info
372:         userDetails[_account].collateral = accDetails.collateral - collateralToLiquidate;
373:         userDetails[_account].debt = accDetails.debt - _debtAmount;
374: 
375:         // Burn liquidator's Tau
376:         TAU(tau).burnFrom(msg.sender, _debtAmount);
377: 
378:         // Transfer part of _debtAmount to liquidator and Taurus as fees for liquidation
379:         IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, collateralToLiquidator);
380:         IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(
381:             Controller(controller).addressMapper(Constants.FEE_SPLITTER),
382:             liquidationSurcharge
383:         );
384: 
385:         emit AccountLiquidated(msg.sender, _account, collateralToLiquidate, liquidationSurcharge);
386: 
387:         return true;
388:     }

```

Escalate for 10 USDC

PriceOracleManger is Ownable contract so yes it has `owner` param and not `governor` param. So here owner can be governor, timelock and multisig. Also when it come to calling `updateWrapper` multisig can be trusted as it can be trusted to not set deposit fee to max and loot all users. So with that being said this is info/low issue and does not qualify for medium. It may be possible that is entirely out of scope as it is related to admin controlled param.

You've created a valid escalation for 10 USDC!

To remove the escalation from consideration: Delete your comment.

You may delete or edit your escalation comment anytime before the 48-hour escalation window closes. After that, the escalation becomes final.

Escalation rejected

Given that the protocol clearly mentions that admin should be restricted whenever possible from affecting the user collateral adding the restriction makes sense. 
Considering this issue a valid medium.
