## Vulnerability Title

Too many DSC tokens can get minted for fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Overview


This report discusses a bug found in the `DSCEngine` contract, which can lead to too many `DSC` tokens being minted. This can happen when the contract is used with fee-on-transfer tokens, where only a portion of the tokens are received due to transfer fees. The root cause of the bug is a miscalculation in the `depositCollateral` function, which assumes that the full amount of collateral is received. This can potentially cause a depeg in the system. The report recommends checking the actual amount of received tokens to prevent this issue.

## Summary
The `DSCEngine` contract overcalculates the collateral when operating with fee-on-transfer tokens, which can lead to too many `DSC` tokens being minted.


## Vulnerability Details
The competition description mentions that while the first use-case for the system will be a WETH/WBTC backed stablecoin, the system is supposed to generally work with **any** collateral tokens. If one or more collateral tokens are fee-on-transfer tokens, i.e., when transferring `X` tokens, only `X - F` tokens arrive at the recipient side, where `F` denotes the transfer fee, depositors get credited too much collateral, meaning more `DSC` tokens can get minted, which leads to a potential depeg.

The root cause is the `depositCollateral` function in `DSCEngine`:

```solidity
function depositCollateral(address tokenCollateralAddress, uint256 amountCollateral)
        public
        moreThanZero(amountCollateral)
        isAllowedToken(tokenCollateralAddress)
        nonReentrant
    {
        s_collateralDeposited[msg.sender][tokenCollateralAddress] += amountCollateral;
        emit CollateralDeposited(msg.sender, tokenCollateralAddress, amountCollateral);
        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountCollateral);
        if (!success) {
            revert DSCEngine__TransferFailed();
        }
    }
```

As can be seen in line 
```solidity
bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountCollateral);
````
the contract assumes that the full `amountCollateral` is received, which might not be the case with fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Impact
When the contract operates with fee-on-transfer tokens as collateral, too many `DSC` tokens can get minted based on the overcalculated collateral, potentially leading to a depeg.

## Tools Used
None

## Recommendations
Check the actual amount of received tokens:
```solidity
function depositCollateral(address tokenCollateralAddress, uint256 amountCollateral)
        public
        moreThanZero(amountCollateral)
        isAllowedToken(tokenCollateralAddress)
        nonReentrant
    {
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountCollateral);
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        amountCollateral = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        if (!success) {
            revert DSCEngine__TransferFailed();
        }
        s_collateralDeposited[msg.sender][tokenCollateralAddress] += amountCollateral;
        emit CollateralDeposited(msg.sender, tokenCollateralAddress, amountCollateral);
    }
```
