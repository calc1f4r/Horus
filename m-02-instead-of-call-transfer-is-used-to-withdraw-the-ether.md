## Vulnerability Title

[M-02] instead of `call()` , `transfer()` is used to withdraw the ether

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in the withdraw function of a smart contract. The vulnerability is that when a user attempts to withdraw ETH, it uses the transfer() function, which can fail if the withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable function, if it implements a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas units, or if the payable fallback function is called through a proxy that raises the call's gas usage above 2300. A proof of concept can be found in the link provided. No tools were used to find the vulnerability. The recommended mitigation step is to use call() to send ETH instead of transfer().

## Vulnerability details

## Impact

function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(amount <= ethBalance[msg.sender]);
        ethBalance[msg.sender] = ethBalance[msg.sender].sub(amount);
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount);
    }

To withdraw eth it uses transfer(), this trnansaction will fail inevitably when : - 

1. The withdrwer smart contract does not implement a payable function.

2. Withdrawer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit

3. Thw withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function whicn needs less than 2300 gas unit but is called through proxy that raise the call's gas usage above 2300
