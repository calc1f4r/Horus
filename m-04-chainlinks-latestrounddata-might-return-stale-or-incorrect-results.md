## Vulnerability Title

[M-04] Chainlink's `latestRoundData` might return stale or incorrect results

### Overview


This bug report addresses a potential issue with the `PriceFeed` contract, which uses a ChainLink aggregator to fetch the latest price data. Currently, there is no check in place to ensure that the data being returned is not stale. The only check present is for the `quoteAnswer` to be greater than 0, but this is not enough to prevent the use of outdated data. This could lead to incorrect values being produced for important functions in the system. The report recommends adding additional checks for stale data and provides a proof of concept for how this could be implemented. The bug has been confirmed and given a medium-risk rating due to the low likelihood of it occurring but the potential for devastating consequences. 

### Original Finding Content


In the `PriceFeed` contract, the protocol uses a ChainLink aggregator to fetch the `latestRoundData()`, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data. The only check present is for the `quoteAnswer` to be `> 0`; however, this alone is not sufficient.

```solidity
function getSqrtPrice() external view returns (uint256 sqrtPrice) {
@>        (, int256 quoteAnswer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(_quotePriceFeed).latestRoundData(); // missing additional checks

        IPyth.Price memory basePrice = IPyth(_pyth).getPriceNoOlderThan(_priceId, VALID_TIME_PERIOD);

        require(basePrice.expo == -8, "INVALID_EXP");

        require(quoteAnswer > 0 && basePrice.price > 0);

        uint256 price = uint256(int256(basePrice.price)) * Constants.Q96 / uint256(quoteAnswer);
        price = price * Constants.Q96 / _decimalsDiff;

        sqrtPrice = FixedPointMathLib.sqrt(price);
    }
```

The protocol mentions that:

> Attacks that stem from the TWAP being extremely stale compared to the market price within its period (currently 30 minutes) are a known risk. As a general rule, only price manipulation issues that can be triggered by manipulating the price atomically from a normal pool or oracle state are valid.

However, this `stale` period check is only currently applied to the `Pyth` integration, where the ChainLink feed is not considered for stale data.

This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds).

This discrepancy could have the protocol produce incorrect values for very important functions in different places across the system, such as `GammaTradeMarket`, `PositionCalculator`, `LiquidationLogic`, etc.

### Proof of Concept

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding missing checks for stale data:

```diff
@@ -43,7 +43,10 @@ contract PriceFeed {
 
     /// @notice This function returns the square root of the baseToken price quoted in quoteToken.
     function getSqrtPrice() external view returns (uint256 sqrtPrice) {
-        (, int256 quoteAnswer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(_quotePriceFeed).latestRoundData();
+        (uint80 quoteRoundID, int256 quoteAnswer,, uint256 quoteTimestamp, uint80 quoteAnsweredInRound) =
+            AggregatorV3Interface(_quotePriceFeed).latestRoundData();
+        require(quoteAnsweredInRound >= quoteRoundID, "Stale price!");
+        require(quoteTimestamp != 0, "Round not complete!");
+        require(block.timestamp - quoteTimestamp <= VALID_TIME_PERIOD);
```

 > The Warden has demonstrated how the Chainlink oracle employed by the system does not impose any staleness check, permitting misbehavior in the Chainlink system to not be detected by the system and the system to continue utilizing a stale price, similar to the Luna flash crash.

> I believe a medium-risk rating is appropriate given the low likelihood of such an event but the devastating consequences it could result in.

> A subset of the duplicates have been penalized for not properly justifying why the staleness check should be applied, for advising an incorrect alleviation (i.e., round ID based), and/or for being of lower quality than acceptable.
