## Vulnerability Title

Reward restaking creates unnecessary unbonding in edge cases

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content

**Description:** The `PolygonStrategy::restakeRewards()` function is publicly callable by anyone, allowing rewards to be restaked immediately before the `PolygonStrategy::unbond()` function is called.

In specific scenarios, this can cause the protocol to unnecessarily unbond principal funds when rewards would have been sufficient to satisfy withdrawal requests.

The issue stems from how rewards are calculated in the `unbond()` function:

```solidity
// In PolygonStrategy::unbond()
uint256 deposits = vault.getTotalDeposits();
uint256 principalDeposits = vault.getPrincipalDeposits();
uint256 rewards = deposits - principalDeposits; //@audit this would be 0 if restakeRewards is called just before

if (rewards >= toUnbondRemaining) {
    vault.withdrawRewards();
    toUnbondRemaining = 0;
} else {
    toUnbondRemaining -= rewards;
    uint256 vaultToUnbond = principalDeposits >= toUnbondRemaining
        ? toUnbondRemaining
        : principalDeposits;

    vault.unbond(vaultToUnbond);

    toUnbondRemaining -= vaultToUnbond;
    ++numVaultsUnbonded; //@audit this will be 1 more than necessary
}

```

Meanwhile, the `PolygonStrategy::restakeRewards()` function is publicly accessible:

```solidity
// In PolygonStrategy::restakeRewards()
function restakeRewards(uint256[] calldata _vaultIds) external {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _vaultIds.length; ++i) {
        vaults[_vaultIds[i]].restakeRewards();
    }

    emit RestakeRewards();
}
```

**Impact:** Consider a specific scenario:

- First eligible vault has sufficient rewards to cover an unbonding request completely
- Just before unbond() is called, Alice calls restakeRewards()
- When unbond() executes, it finds no rewards and must unbond principal instead
- This unnecessarily increments numVaultsUnbonding

In this scenario, queued token deposits will face denial of service

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following:

```javascript
 describe.only('restakeRewards forces protocol to wait for withdrawal delay', async () => {
    it('should force protocol to wait for withdrawal delay', async () => {
      const { token, strategy, vaults, fundFlowController, withdrawalPool, validatorShare } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture)

      await withdrawalPool.setTotalQueuedWithdrawals(toEther(960))
      assert.equal(await fundFlowController.shouldUnbondVaults(), true);

      // 1. Pre-condition: one validator can cover the amount to unbond with his rewards.
      await validatorShare.addReward(vaults[0].target, toEther(1000));

      // 2. User front-runs the unbondVaults transaction and restakes rewards for validators.
      await strategy.restakeRewards([0]);

      const totalQueuedBefore = await strategy.totalQueued();
      // 3. Protocol is forced to unbond and wait for withdrawal delay even though
      // it could obtain the funds after calling vault.withdrawRewards.
      await fundFlowController.unbondVaults()
      const totalQueuedAfter = await strategy.totalQueued();

      assert.equal(await fundFlowController.shouldUnbondVaults(), false)

      // 4. TotalQueued did not increase, meaning strategy could not withdraw any funds
      // and vault is unbending(it wouldn't be if it cover the funds with the rewards).
      assert.equal(totalQueuedBefore, totalQueuedAfter)
      assert.equal(await vaults[0].isUnbonding(), true)
    })
  })
```

Here is the output:

```javascript
  PolygonFundFlowController
    restakeRewards forces protocol to wait for withdrawal delay
      ✔ should force protocol to wait for withdrawal delay (626ms)


  1 passing (628ms)
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider restricting access to `restakeRewards` in both the strategy and vault contracts.


**Stake.Link:** Acknowledged. There should never be a significant amount of unclaimed rewards under normal circumstances as they will be claimed every time there is a deposit/unbond.

**Cyfrin:** Acknowledged.
