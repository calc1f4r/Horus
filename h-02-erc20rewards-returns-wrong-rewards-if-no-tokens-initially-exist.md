## Vulnerability Title

[H-02] ERC20Rewards returns wrong rewards if no tokens initially exist

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in the ERC20Rewards._updateRewardsPerToken function. If the total supply of tokens is zero, the function exits without updating rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated, which can lead to an error if there is an active rewards period but no tokens have been minted yet. This means that the first user to mint tokens will receive all the rewards for the past period, even though they should not receive any. This can easily happen when a token is new and the reward period has already been initialized. 

The recommended mitigation step for this bug is to ensure that the rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated field is always updated in the _updateRewardsPerToken function to the current time (or end) even if the total supply is zero. The function should not return early.

## Vulnerability details

The `ERC20Rewards._updateRewardsPerToken` function exits without updating `rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated` if `totalSupply` is zero, i.e., if there are no tokens initially.

This leads to an error if there is an active rewards period but not tokens have been minted yet.

**Example:** `rewardsPeriod.start: 1 month ago`, `rewardsPeriod.end: in 1 month`, `totalSupply == 0`.
The first mint leads to the user (mintee) receiving all rewards for the past period (50% of the total rewards in this case).
- `_mint` is called, calls `_updateRewardsPerToken` which short-circuits. `rewardsPerToken.lastUpdated` is still set to `rewardsPeriod.start` from the constructor. Then `_updateUserRewards` is called and does not currently yield any rewards. (because both balance and the index diff are zero). User is now minted the tokens, `totalSupply` increases and user balance is set.
- User performs a `claim`: `_updateRewardsPerToken` is called and `timeSinceLastUpdated = end - rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated = block.timestamp - rewardsPeriod.start = 1 month`. Contract "issues" rewards for the past month. The first mintee receives all of it.

## Impact
The first mintee receives all pending rewards when they should not receive any past rewards.
This can easily happen if the token is new, the reward period has already been initialized and is running, but the protocol has not officially launched yet.
Note that `setRewards` also allows setting a date in the past which would also be fatal in this case.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
The `rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated` field must always be updated in `_updateRewardsPerToken` to the current time (or `end`) even if `_totalSupply == 0`. Don't return early.
