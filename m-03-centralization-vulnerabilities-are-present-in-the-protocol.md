## Vulnerability Title

[M-03] Centralization vulnerabilities are present in the protocol

### Overview


This bug report is about the owner of BatonLaunchpad having total control of the nftImplementation and feeRate storage variable values in the contract. This can lead to a rug pull, front-running, and stuck ETH in the contract. The severity of this bug is high as it can lead to a rug pull, but the likelihood is low as it requires a compromised or malicious owner.

The recommendations given are to make the nftImplementation method callable only once, so the value can't be updated after initially set. For the feeRate, add a MAX_FEE_RATE constant value and check that the new value is less than or equal to it. For the Caviar dependency issue, call it with try-catch and just complete the locking of LP or seeding of the yield farm if the call throws an error.

Overall, this bug report highlights the potential risks of having an owner with total control of the nftImplementation and feeRate storage variable values in the contract. It is important to take the recommended steps to mitigate these risks and ensure that the contract is secure.

### Original Finding Content

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it can lead to a rug pull

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a compromised or a malicious owner

**Description**

The `owner` of `BatonLaunchpad` has total control of the `nftImplementation` and `feeRate` storage variable values in the contract. This opens up some attack vectors:

1. The `owner` of `BatonLaunchpad` can front-run a `create` call to change the `nftImplementation` contract to one that also has a method with which he can withdraw the mint fees from it, resulting in a "rug pull"
2. The `owner` of `BatonLaunchpad` can change the fee to a much higher value, either forcing the `Nft` minters to pay a huge fee or just to make them not want to mint any tokens.
3. The `owner` of the `Caviar` dependency can call `close` on the `Pair` contract, meaning that the `nftAdd` call in `lockLp` and the `wrap` call in `seedYieldFarm` would revert. This can mean that the locking of LP and the seeding of the yield farm can never complete, meaning the `owner` of the `Nft` contract can never call `withdraw`, leading to stuck ETH in the contract.

**Recommendations**

Make the `nftImplementation` method callable only once, so the value can't be updated after initially set. For the `feeRate` add a `MAX_FEE_RATE` constant value and check that the new value is less than or equal to it. For the `Caviar` dependency issue you can call it with `try-catch` and just complete the locking of LP or seeding of the yield farm if the call throws an error.
