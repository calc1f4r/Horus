## Vulnerability Title

[M-02] Dangerous use of deadline parameter

### Overview


This bug report discusses an issue with the particle protocol's use of a deadline parameter when interacting with the Uniswap NFT Position Manager. The protocol is currently using `block.timestamp` as the deadline argument, which defeats the purpose of having a deadline. This can potentially allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point, causing harm to the submitter. The recommendation is to add a proper deadline parameter to each of the functions used to manage the liquidity position, and to forward this parameter to the underlying calls to the Uniswap NonfungiblePositionManager contract.

The protocol is using `block.timestamp` as the deadline argument while interacting with the Uniswap NFT Position Manager, which completely defeats the purpose of using a deadline.

### Impact

Actions in the Uniswap NonfungiblePositionManager contract are protected by a `deadline` parameter to limit the execution of pending transactions. Functions that modify the liquidity of the pool check this parameter against the current block timestamp in order to discard expired actions.

These interactions with the Uniswap position are present in the LiquidityPosition library. The functions `mint()`, `increaseLiquidity()` and `decreaseLiquidity()` call their corresponding functions in the Uniswap Position Manager, providing `block.timestamp` as the argument for the `deadline` parameter:

```solidity
131:         // mint the position
132:         (tokenId, liquidity, amount0Minted, amount1Minted) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER.mint(
133:             INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams({
134:                 token0: params.token0,
135:                 token1: params.token1,
136:                 fee: params.fee,
137:                 tickLower: params.tickLower,
138:                 tickUpper: params.tickUpper,
139:                 amount0Desired: params.amount0ToMint,
140:                 amount1Desired: params.amount1ToMint,
141:                 amount0Min: params.amount0Min,
142:                 amount1Min: params.amount1Min,
143:                 recipient: address(this),
144:                 deadline: block.timestamp
145:             })
146:         );

```solidity
189:         // increase liquidity via position manager
190:         (liquidity, amount0Added, amount1Added) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER.increaseLiquidity(
191:             INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
192:                 tokenId: tokenId,
193:                 amount0Desired: amount0,
194:                 amount1Desired: amount1,
195:                 amount0Min: 0,
196:                 amount1Min: 0,
197:                 deadline: block.timestamp
198:             })
199:         );
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-particle/blob/a3af40839b24aa13f5764d4f84933dbfa8bc8134/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L254-L262>

```solidity
254:         (amount0, amount1) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER.decreaseLiquidity(
255:             INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
256:                 tokenId: tokenId,
257:                 liquidity: liquidity,
258:                 amount0Min: 0,
259:                 amount1Min: 0,
260:                 deadline: block.timestamp
261:             })
262:         );
```

Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline is effectively a no-operation that has no effect nor protection. Since `block.timestamp` will take the timestamp value when the transaction gets mined, the check will end up comparing `block.timestamp` against the same value, i.e. `block.timestamp <= block.timestamp` (see <https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/base/PeripheryValidation.sol#L7>).

Failure to provide a proper deadline value enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point. Transactions that provide an insufficient amount of gas such that they are not mined within a reasonable amount of time, can be picked by malicious actors or MEV bots and executed later in detriment of the submitter.

See [this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-backed-findings/issues/64) for an excellent reference on the topic (the author runs a MEV bot).

### Recommendation

Add a deadline parameter to each of the functions that are used to manage the liquidity position, `ParticlePositionManager.mint()`, `ParticlePositionManager.increaseLiquidity()` and `ParticlePositionManager.decreaseLiquidity()`. Forward this parameter to the corresponding underlying calls to the Uniswap NonfungiblePositionManager contract.

 > Good practice to learn! Will add a proper in the input timestamp.
