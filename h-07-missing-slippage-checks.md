## Vulnerability Title

[H-07] Missing slippage checks

### Overview


This bug report concerns a vulnerability in the Router and Pool of a system that does not have any slippage checks to compare the swap/liquidity results with a minimum swap/liquidity value. This means that users can be frontrun and receive a worse price than expected, and there is no protection or minimum return amount for the trade transaction to be valid. This can lead to a loss of user funds.

The recommended mitigation step is to add some sort of protection for the user such that they receive their desired amounts, and to add a minimum return amount for all swap and liquidity provisions/removals to all Router functions. This will help to ensure that users receive the desired price and that their funds are not lost due to frontrunning or other malicious activities.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by cmichel, also found by tensors_

There are no minimum amounts out, or checks that frontrunning/slippage is sufficiently mitigated.
This means that anyone with enough capital can force arbitrarily large slippage by sandwiching transactions, close to 100%. See issue page for referenced code.

Recommend adding a minimum amount out parameter. The function reverts if the minimum amount isn't obtained.

> We acknowledge the issue for the protocol's AMM, but if this becomes a large issue in the future, the router is easily upgradeable to include a minimum rate parameter.

**[SamusEldburg (Spartan) confirmed and disagreed with severity:](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan-findings/issues/85#issuecomment-889638485)**
> Have changed this to confirmed; even though we already were aware of it; we have discussed and are happy to add in a UI-handed arg for minAmount now rather than reactively in the future. Disagree with severity though; this wasn't a problem with V1 at all.

**[ghoul-sol (Judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan-findings/issues/85#issuecomment-894863717):**
> I'll keep high risk as sandwich attacks are very common and risk of getting a bad swap is real.
