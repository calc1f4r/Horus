## Vulnerability Title

[M-05] BkdLocker#depositFees() can be front run to steal the newly added rewardToken

### Overview


This bug report is about the vulnerability in the BkdLocker#depositFees() function. This function is responsible for distributing rewards to existing stakeholders every time it is called. If the admin configures the _WITHDRAW_DELAY to a very short period of time or even 0, it allows an attacker to frontrun the 1st transaction, taking a large portion of the shares before the surge and then claim the rewards and exit immediately. This would enable the attacker to steal the major part of the newly added rewards. A proof of concept (PoC) is provided in the report. The recommendation is to switch the reward to a rewardRate-based gradual release model, such as Synthetix's StakingRewards contract.

## Vulnerability details

Every time the `BkdLocker#depositFees()` gets called, there will be a surge of rewards per locked token for the existing stakeholders.

This enables a well-known attack vector, in which the attacker will take a large portion of the shares before the surge, then claim the rewards and exit immediately.

While the `_WITHDRAW_DELAY` can be set longer to mitigate this issue in the current implementation, it is possible for the admin to configure it to a very short period of time or even `0`.

In which case, the attack will be very practical and effectively steal the major part of the newly added rewards.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L90-L100

```solidity
function depositFees(uint256 amount) external override {
    require(amount > 0, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT);
    require(totalLockedBoosted > 0, Error.NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS);
    IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    RewardTokenData storage curRewardTokenData = rewardTokenData[rewardToken];

    curRewardTokenData.feeIntegral += amount.scaledDiv(totalLockedBoosted);
    curRewardTokenData.feeBalance += amount;
    emit FeesDeposited(amount);
}
```

### PoC

Given:

- Current `totalLockedBoosted()` is `100,000 govToken`;
- Pending distribution fees amount is `1,000 rewardToken`;

1. `depositFees()` is called to add `1,000 rewardToken`;
2. The attacker frontrun the 1st transaction with a `lock()` transaction to deposit `100,000 govToken`, taking 50% of the pool;
3. After the transaction in step 1 is mined, the attacker calls `claimFees()` and received `500 rewardToken`.

As a result, the attacker has stolen half of the pending fees which belong to the old users.

### Recommendation

Consider switching the reward to a `rewardRate`-based gradual release model, such as Synthetix's StakingRewards contract.
