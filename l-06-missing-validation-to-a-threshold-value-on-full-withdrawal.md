## Vulnerability Title

[L-06] Missing validation to a threshold value on full withdrawal

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content


### Proof of Concept
According to the [docs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/138cf7edb887f641ae48e33e963ab1be4ff474c1/docs/EigenPods.md) there's supposed to be a validation against a const on full withdrawal, but its missing, which can lead to the system not working as expected.
>In this second case, in order to withdraw their balance from the EigenPod, stakers must provide a valid proof of their full withdrawal (differentiated from partial withdrawals through a simple comparison of the amount to a threshold value named MIN_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT_GWEI) against a beacon state root.
```solidity
    function _processFullWithdrawal(
        uint64 withdrawalAmountGwei,
        uint40 validatorIndex,
        uint256 beaconChainETHStrategyIndex,
        address recipient,
        VALIDATOR_STATUS status
    ) internal {
        uint256 amountToSend;

        // if the validator has not previously been proven to be "overcommitted"
        if (status == VALIDATOR_STATUS.ACTIVE) {
            // if the withdrawal amount is greater than the REQUIRED_BALANCE_GWEI (i.e. the amount restaked on EigenLayer, per ETH validator)
            if (withdrawalAmountGwei >= REQUIRED_BALANCE_GWEI) {
                // then the excess is immediately withdrawable
                amountToSend = uint256(withdrawalAmountGwei - REQUIRED_BALANCE_GWEI) * uint256(GWEI_TO_WEI);
                // and the extra execution layer ETH in the contract is REQUIRED_BALANCE_GWEI, which must be withdrawn through EigenLayer's normal withdrawal process
                restakedExecutionLayerGwei += REQUIRED_BALANCE_GWEI;
            } else {
                // otherwise, just use the full withdrawal amount to continue to "back" the podOwner's remaining shares in EigenLayer (i.e. none is instantly withdrawable)
                restakedExecutionLayerGwei += withdrawalAmountGwei;
                // remove and undelegate 'extra' (i.e. "overcommitted") shares in EigenLayer
