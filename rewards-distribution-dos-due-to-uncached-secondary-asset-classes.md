## Vulnerability Title

Rewards distribution DoS due to uncached secondary asset classes

### Overview


This bug report describes an issue with the rewards calculation in the Suzaku network. The calculation directly accesses a mapping instead of using a function, which can lead to a division by zero error. This error can occur when specific asset classes are not properly cached, which can happen when certain operations are not performed. This can result in a failure to distribute rewards for affected epochs. A proof of concept test has been provided to demonstrate the issue. The recommended mitigation is to check and cache the stake for asset IDs if it does not exist. The bug has been fixed in a recent commit and has been verified by the Cyfrin team.

### Original Finding Content

**Description:** The rewards calculation directly accesses the totalStakeCache mapping instead of using the getTotalStake() function with proper fallback logic:

```solidity
function _calculateOperatorShare(uint48 epoch, address operator) internal {
  // code..

  uint96[] memory assetClasses = l1Middleware.getAssetClassIds();
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < assetClasses.length; i++) {
       uint256 totalStake = l1Middleware.totalStakeCache(epoch, assetClasses[i]); //@audit directly accesses totalStakeCache
  }
}
```
Only specific operations trigger caching for secondary asset classes:
```solidity
// @audit following only cache PRIMARY_ASSET_CLASS (asset class 1)
addNode(...) updateStakeCache(getCurrentEpoch(), PRIMARY_ASSET_CLASS)
forceUpdateNodes(...) updateStakeCache(getCurrentEpoch(), PRIMARY_ASSET_CLASS)

// @audit only caches the specific asset class being slashed
slash(epoch, operator, amount, assetClassId) updateStakeCache(epoch, assetClassId)
```
Secondary asset classes (2, 3, etc.) are only cached when:

- Slashing occurs for that specific asset class (infrequent)
- Manual calcAndCacheStakes() calls (requires intervention)

As a result, when rewards distributor calls `distributeRewards`, for the specific asset class ID with uncached stake, `_calculateOperatorShare` leads to a division by zero error.

**Impact:** Rewards distribution fails for affected epochs. It is worthwhile to note that DoS is temporary - manual intervention by calling `calcAndCacheStakes` for specific asset class ID's can fix the DoS error.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following test to `RewardsTest.t.sol`

```solidity
function test_RewardsDistributionDOS_With_UncachedSecondaryAssetClasses() public {
    uint48 epoch = 1;
    uint256 uptime = 4 hours;

    // Setup stakes for operators normally
    _setupStakes(epoch, uptime);

    // Set totalStakeCache to 0 for secondary asset classes to simulate uncached state
    middleware.setTotalStakeCache(epoch, 2, 0); // Secondary asset class 2
    middleware.setTotalStakeCache(epoch, 3, 0); // Secondary asset class 3

    // Keep primary asset class cached (this would be cached by addNode/forceUpdateNodes)
    middleware.setTotalStakeCache(epoch, 1, 100000); // This stays cached


    // Move to epoch where distribution is allowed (must be at least 2 epochs ahead)
    vm.warp((epoch + 3) * middleware.EPOCH_DURATION());

    // Attempt to distribute rewards - this should fail due to division by zero
    // when _calculateOperatorShare tries to calculate rewards for uncached secondary asset classes
    vm.expectRevert(); // This should revert due to division by zero in share calculation

    vm.prank(REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE);
    rewards.distributeRewards(epoch, 3);
}

```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider checking and caching stake for assetIds if it doesn't exist.

```diff solidity
function _calculateOperatorShare(uint48 epoch, address operator) internal {
  // code..

  uint96[] memory assetClasses = l1Middleware.getAssetClassIds();
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < assetClasses.length; i++) {
++       uint256 totalStake = l1Middleware.totalStakeCache(epoch, assetClasses[i]);
++       if (totalStake == 0) {
++            l1Middleware.calcAndCacheStakes(epoch, assetClasses[i]);
++             totalStake = l1Middleware.totalStakeCache(epoch, assetClasses[i]);
++       }
       // code
  }
}
```
