## Vulnerability Title

[M-30] `StakingRewards` reward rate can be dragged out and diluted

### Overview


This bug report is about the `StakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount` function in the code which is located at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L161. This function receives a `reward` amount and extends the current reward end time to `now + rewardsDuration`. It rebases the currently remaining rewards + the new rewards (`reward + leftover`) over this new `rewardsDuration` period.

The vulnerability of this function is that it can lead to a dilution of the reward rate and rewards being dragged out forever by malicious new reward deposits. For example, imagine the current rewardRate is `1000 rewards / rewardsDuration`. 20% of the `rewardsDuration` passed and a malicious actor notifies the contract with a reward of `0`. This will reduce the `rewardRate` by 20%. This can be repeated infinitely.

The recommended mitigation steps for this vulnerability are to consider not extending the reward payouts by `rewardsDuration` on every call. Alternatively, consider keeping the `rewardRate` constant but extend `periodFinish` time by `+= reward / rewardRate`.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by cmichel_

[StakingRewards.sol#L161](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L161)<br>

The `StakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount` function receives a `reward` amount and extends the current reward end time to `now + rewardsDuration`.<br>
It rebases the currently remaining rewards + the new rewards (`reward + leftover`) over this new `rewardsDuration` period.

```solidity
function withdraw(IERC20 _token, address _to) external override {
    require(activated[_token] != 0 && activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp, "shelter not activated");
    // @audit uses `msg.sender`'s share but sets `claimed` for _to! can claim for many `_to`s
    uint256 amount = savedTokens[_token] * client.shareOf(_token, msg.sender) / client.totalShare(_token);
    claimed[_token][_to] = true;
    emit ExitShelter(_token, msg.sender, _to, amount);
    _token.safeTransfer(_to, amount);
}
```

This can lead to a dilution of the reward rate and rewards being dragged out forever by malicious new reward deposits.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine the current rewardRate is `1000 rewards / rewardsDuration`.<br>
20% of the `rewardsDuration` passed, i.e., `now = lastUpdateTime + 20% * rewardsDuration`.<br>
A malicious actor notifies the contract with a reward of `0`: `notifyRewardAmount(0)`.<br>
Then the new `rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration = (0 + 800) / rewardsDuration = 800 / rewardsDuration`.<br>
The `rewardRate` just dropped by 20%.<br>
This can be repeated infinitely.<br>
After another 20% of reward time passed, they trigger `notifyRewardAmount(0)` to reduce it by another 20% again:<br>
`rewardRate = (0 + 640) / rewardsDuration = 640 / rewardsDuration`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Imo, the `rewardRate` should never decrease by a `notifyRewardAmount` call.<br>
Consider not extending the reward payouts by `rewardsDuration` on every call.<br>
`periodFinish` probably shouldn't change at all, the `rewardRate` should just increase by `rewardRate += reward / (periodFinish - block.timestamp)`.

Alternatively, consider keeping the `rewardRate` constant but extend `periodFinish` time by `+= reward / rewardRate`.

 > The warden is pointing out an admin privilege that would allow the admin to dilute current rewards.
> 
> While the sponsor claims this won't happen, I can only judge based on the code that is available to me.<br>
> And at this point there seems to be no code for the `rewardsDistribution` contract that would be calling `notifyRewardAmount`
> 
> Given this, I believe the finding to be valid as the POC works out to demonstrate how a malicious owner could dilute the rewardRate.
> 
> This would cause loss of yield for all depositors, which makes the finding of Medium Severity.
