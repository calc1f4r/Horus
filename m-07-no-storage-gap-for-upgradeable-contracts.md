## Vulnerability Title

[M-07] No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contracts

### Overview


This bug report describes a vulnerability in upgradeable contracts that can cause unintended consequences. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts. An example of this vulnerability is the `ExpiringMarket` contract which does not contain any storage gap and inherits `SimpleMarket`. If an additional variable is added to the `SimpleMarket` contract, that new variable will overwrite the storage slot of the `stopped` variable in the `ExpiringMarket` contract, causing unintended consequences. Similarly, the `RubiconMarket` contract inherits `ExpiringMarket` and if a new variable is added to the `ExpiringMarket` contract in an upgrade, that variable will overwrite the `buyEnabled` variable in `ExpiringMarket` contract. The recommended mitigation steps for this vulnerability is to add appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below: 

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```

This storage gap will allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments.

### Impact

For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts.

Refer to the bottom part of this article: <https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable>

### Proof of Concept

As an example, the `ExpiringMarket` contract inherits `SimpleMarket`, and the `SimpleMarket` contract does not contain any storage gap. If in a future upgrade, an additional variable is added to the `SimpleMarket` contract, that new variable will overwrite the storage slot of the `stopped` variable in the `ExpiringMarket` contract, causing unintended consequences.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-rubicon/blob/8c312a63a91193c6a192a9aab44ff980fbfd7741/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L448-L449>

Similarly, the `ExpiringMarket` does not contain any storage gap either, and the `RubiconMarket` contract inherits `ExpiringMarket`. If a new variable is added to the `ExpiringMarket` contract in an upgrade, that variable will overwrite the `buyEnabled` variable in `ExpiringMarket` contract.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below. Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```

 > Out of curiosity, is there a reason why the [openzeppelin-upgrades](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades) package isn't used? 
> 
> According to the README, Transparent Upgradeable Proxies is used to make sure "all contracts can be iterated and improved over time." seems like the `initializable` contract should've been inherited and utilized so that you wouldn't have to worry about adding in storage gaps.

> Optimism had a custom compiler that required custom proxies. This led to the package not working otherwise I would have used it.
> 
> It seems like always extending the top-level storage contract as a practice should avoid any issues here, right? It is a good issue that highlights I should never try to extend inherited contract's storage.

 > Ahhh I see. It depends on future upgrades that will affect the storage layout. Inheriting from Ownable and Pausable for instance shouldnt affect upgradeability much because I dont think their required functionality will drastically change. 
> 
> But yeah, ensuring there is sufficient gap is to future-proof the contracts. Worst case, do a new deployment.

> I just ran into this attempting to add the Reentrancy Gaurd to a contract. To be clear warden should I add this to the end of the existing base contract? For example, appending the uint256[50] gap to the base contract before inheritance?
> 
> Thanks and good issue.

> I'd love to know the appropriate way to bolt on something like `ReentrancyGuard` onto an existing proxy-wrapped contract - is it even possible? 
> 
> My game plan is to bring the `nonReentrant` modifier into the top-level contract to only extend storage. Thank you again warden!
