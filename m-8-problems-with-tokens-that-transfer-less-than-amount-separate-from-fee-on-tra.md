## Vulnerability Title

M-8: Problems with tokens that transfer less than amount. (Separate from fee-on-transfer issues!)

### Overview


A bug report has been raised on the GitHub repository of Sherlock-Audit for 2023-09-Gitcoin-judging. The issue is related to tokens that transfer less than the amount of tokens specified. This issue is separate from fee-on-transfer issues. The contest FAQ states that all weird tokens should work with the protocol. The issue was confirmed with the sponsor.

The issue can cause multiple attacks. Firstly, an attacker can put dust of this token in a wallet, and then call allo.fundPool() with type(uint256).max of this token. If the pool has not already been funded, then poolAmount will not be at type(uint256).max despite nothing being in the pool. Secondly, someone can do this in the DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy to set someones claim of this token to type(uint256).max. It is now impossible for anyone else to donate this token to them.

The impact of this issue is that pools cannot work with such tokens, leading to loss of the base fee and difficulty in recovering funds.

The code snippet is available at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L125. The tool used for review is manual review.

The recommendation is to explicitly not support these tokens. After discussion, the issue was escalated and accepted as valid. It was decided that the impact of this issue is significant enough to assign the issue as a medium.

The token in question is cUSDCv3, which is a deployment of Comet.sol where some functionality is provided by delegating to a deployment of CometExt.sol. The protocol team was asked about this specific category of issues, and they confirmed the issue and are even planning on fixing the issue. The issue is now accepted as valid and assigned as a medium.

### Original Finding Content

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/379 

## Found by 
jkoppel
Some tokens such as cUSDCv3  contain a special case for amount == type(uint256).max in their transfer functions that results in only the user's balance being transferred. This can be used to shut down several pool operations.

There are also problems with fee-on-transfer tokens, but that's a separate issue.

The contest FAQ states that all weird tokens should work with this protocol. I also asked the sponsor about this specific category of issues, and they said "this does like something which can be taken advantage of !"

## Vulnerability Detail

Several things that can go wrong with this:

1. An attacker can put dust of this token in a wallet, and then call allo.fundPool() with type(uint256).max of this token. If the pool has not already been funded, then poolAmount will not be at type(uint256).max  despite nothing being in the pool. It is now not possible to fund the pool.

2. Someone can do this in the DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy to set someones claim of this token to type(uint256).max . It is now impossible for anyone else to donate this token to them.

## Impact

Pools cannot work with such tokens

## Code Snippet

See, e.g.: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L125

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Explicitly do not support these tokens



## Discussion

**jkoppel**

Escalate.

This is not a duplicate of #19. This involves a separate class of token. The available attacks are different, as discussed in the write-up.  This is discussed in the issue write-up and confirmed with sponsor.

You've created a valid escalation!

To remove the escalation from consideration: Delete your comment.

You may delete or edit your escalation comment anytime before the 48-hour escalation window closes. After that, the escalation becomes final.

**nevillehuang**

Agree with escalation, this is a valid issue on its on and not at all related to FOT tokens since all ERC-20 tokens are supported.  

**0x00ffDa**

Valid separate issue, but possibly Low since the impacts listed are DoS / griefing rather than loss of funds. 

**jkoppel**

It causes loss of the base fee.

**0x00ffDa**

> It causes loss of the base fee.

... which can be refunded by the protocol owner using `Allo.recoverFunds()`.

**jkoppel**

There's not clear guidance in the docs, but I can think of other cases where the existence of admin workarounds was insufficient to disqualify something as a medium. n.B. The fee is sent to the treasury, not the Allo contract. Can't use `recoverFunds`.

**neeksec**

Suggest to make this low/info.

Since this is a rare token type and the impact(losing base fee which could be refunded by Allo team) is low.

**Evert0x**

Planning to reject escalation and keep issue state as is.

The impact of this issue is not clear to me. 
> Pools cannot work with such tokens

Does this mean other pool users can't get out? What is the impact on people?

In case the impact is significant I will consider assigning medium. 


**jkoppel**

I mentioned two attacks. It means that multiple attacks are available if someone creates a pool with this token or  tries to use it in donation voting, even though the contract is supposed to work with all token types.

Copied from README

> Do you expect to use any of the following tokens with non-standard behaviour with the smart contracts?
Yes as we support all ERC20 tokens.

It's clear that the issue is in scope. The question to answer is, what is the impact of this issue?

The impact is basically
- DOS on pool funding
- DOS on donations
- Small loss of funds that can technically be recovered but it isn't easy to do so. 

Although the language in the judging guidelines should be improved, I plan on making this a separate Medium because of the following rule. 

> Breaks core contract functionality, rendering the contract useless (should not be easily replaced without loss of funds) or leading to unknown potential exploits/loss of funds. 
Ex: Unable to remove malicious user/collateral from the contract.

The two DOS attacks can break the core contract functionality. In case a pool is popular, it's a blow to the protocol if that pool is suddenly unavailable. It's not easily replaced.

**Evert0x**

@jkoppel I might have misinterpreted the report and was under the assumption it would brick other deposits as well (e.g. USDC, WETH,..)

But I think the scope is only limited to tokens that have this special case "amount == type(uint256).max" in their transfer function

In that case the following rule should be applied as the issue is only related to these tokens.
> Non-Standard tokens: Issues related to tokens with non-standard behaviors, such as [weird-tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) are not considered valid by default unless these tokens are explicitly mentioned in the README.

**jkoppel**

But it is mentioned in the README.

The protocol team was asked this question as part of the standard intake questionnaire.

> Do you expect to use any of the following tokens with non-standard behaviour with the smart contracts?

As part of this question, they were presented a list of tokens with weird behavior, including this one.

They responded:

> Yes as we support all ERC20 tokens.

This should be taken to mean the same as if they had listed every token they were asked about.

**AhmadDecoded**

@jkoppel 
Posted this in discord now posting it here.

hey i think there is need to check the validity of the claim:
```
Some tokens such as cUSDCv3 contain a special case for amount == type(uint256).max in their transfer functions that results in only the user's balance being transferred. This can be used to shut down several pool operations.
```

Which have been copied from :

https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20

But as I confirmed from the compound dev, that is only true for internal transfer with in the compound v3 vaults

The code for the ctoken itself does not work like that and works as any standard erc20 token

So the token that you gave example of cusdcv3, that token itself would work fine with the protocol, so in this case the submission becomes arbitrary and invalid anyways, anyone can craft example of a token that may not work with one or other functionality.

Considering the sherlock rules just add another layer of argument.

Here you can see what the dev have to say, also you can look into code yourself, the functionality you mentioned is for internal transfer with in compound v3 vaults in comet files, transfer between accounts works as any normal working erc20 tokens.

**nevillehuang**

I found the ERC20 implementation of `transferFrom` of the [cUSDCv3 token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbfc4feec175996c08c8f3a0469793a7979526065#code):

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint amount) override external returns (bool) {
        transferInternal(msg.sender, src, dst, baseToken, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

which calls the internal `transferInternal` function here so I think the dev might be incorrect here.  If you call fundpool with type(uint256).max it seems like it does only transfer the amount of tokens the user owns.
```solidity
    function transferInternal(address operator, address src, address dst, address asset, uint amount) internal {
        if (isTransferPaused()) revert Paused();
        if (!hasPermission(src, operator)) revert Unauthorized();
        if (src == dst) revert NoSelfTransfer();

        if (asset == baseToken) {
            if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
                amount = balanceOf(src);
            }
            return transferBase(src, dst, amount);
        } else {
            return transferCollateral(src, dst, asset, safe128(amount));
        }
    }
```

Now comes the dilemma between whether this behavior is "weird" token or not (which is not considered valid in sherlocks guidelines) or is the contest READ.ME on the question about non-standard tokens takes priority (sherlock guidelines states the contest details is the single source of truth).  One thing important to note that while I could not find much data on the use of this token, it has a [total market valuation of >$350 million dollars](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x1be94918e967bcfda70456a3c7ca5dcf27b233a8/), which is quite significant. 

I will let @Evert0x decide on this one but I am leaning towards validating this issue. But perhaps moving forward, more defined rules revolving weird ERC20 tokens needs to be considered.

**AhmadDecoded**

@nevillehuang you are checking wrong contract 🙂
Comet file represent the market for that token, not the token itself. 
Those all transfer functions are for internal transfers within that market. Should have asked before commenting.

As far as the question whether the behaviour is weird or not if it exists, this example have been taken directly from the weird tokens github repo.

**AhmadDecoded**

@quentin-abei you are trying to create mess to impose your decision on judge here. We are discussing validity as the token implementation is being misjudged here. If you want to comvince judge for your issue do it under your own issue, don't try negative reinforcement.

**nevillehuang**

> @nevillehuang you are checking wrong contract 🙂 Comet file represent the market for that token, not the token itself. Those all transfer functions are for internal transfers within that market. Should have asked before commenting.

Oh, could you then point me to the correct contract and function details? My understanding is cUSDv3 is a proxy of the implementation contract i linked. Perhaps @jkoppel should assist in this since burden of proof is on the watson.

**jkoppel**

Not having seen the discussion here, I just spent about 30 minutes hunting for the cUSDCv3 contract. The final answer would require unraveling their deployment scripts, but I'm pretty sure Neville is correct, sans a nitpick. 

The description for the Comet repo is "An efficient money market protocol for Ethereum and compatible chains (aka Compound III, Compound v3)." So this looks like the right place.

There are no references to the string "cUSDCv3" in the code. But there are several in configuration files.

Comet.sol implements 5 of the 7 ERC20 methods, all but `name` and `symbol`.

This diagram states that Comet delegatecalls to CometExt: https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/22cf923b6263177555272dde8b0791703895517d/diagrams/inheritance_diagram.uml . You can see that Comet does indeed implement fallback() and delegatecall's all other methods to another contract: https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/22cf923b6263177555272dde8b0791703895517d/contracts/Comet.sol#L1318

CometExt provides the missing name() and symbol() methods, which it pulls from data: https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/22cf923b6263177555272dde8b0791703895517d/contracts/CometExt.sol#L71

So it looks indeed that Comet.sol is in fact the implementation code for cUSDCv3, and it does have the issue reported in the Weird ERC20 repo. 

In conclusion: cUSDCv3 is almost certainly a deployment of Comet.sol where some functionality is provided by delegating to a deployment of CometExt.sol.

I have also E-mailed the person who added this issue  to the Weird ERC20 repo to confirm.


I think what probably caused the confusion is that the Compound dev saw the function name `transferInternal` and misunderstood it. It appears this dev has edited the documentation in this repo, but has not actually touched protocol code. https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/commits?author=ajb413

**Evert0x**

It seems like @jkoppel is correct that the `cUSDCv3` token contains the behavior described in his initial report. 

It's a hard judgment to make as the context QA doesn't align with the judging guidelines

README states
> Do you expect to use any of the following tokens with non-standard behavior with the smart contracts?
> Yes as we support all ERC20 tokens.

Judging rules state
> Issues related to tokens with non-standard behaviors, such as [weird-tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) are not considered valid by default unless these tokens are **explicitly** mentioned in the README.

`cUSDCv3` is not explicitly mentioned in the README. But the protocol indicated they plan on supporting any token with non-standard behavior. 

The last resort is to depend on the opinion of the protocol, they confirmed the issue and are even planning on fixing the issue. 




**AhmadDecoded**

Ok my mistake, I ran a simulation on tenderly, it does actually works like described.

I will leave it here, now upto judge for the final decision about the ruling on the weird tokens.
