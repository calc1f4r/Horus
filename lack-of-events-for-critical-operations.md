## Vulnerability Title

Lack of events for critical operations

### Overview


This bug report is about a configuration issue in three of the CrosslayerPortal contracts. The problem is that several critical operations do not trigger events, making it difficult to review the correct behavior of the contracts once they have been deployed. As an example, the setRelayer function in the MosaicVault contract does not emit an event providing confirmation of that operation. Without events, users and blockchain-monitoring systems cannot easily detect suspicious behavior.

The exploit scenario is that an attacker is able to take ownership of the MosaicVault contract and set a new relayer address without anyone being aware of the change.

The short-term recommendation is to add events for all critical operations that result in state changes. Events aid in contract monitoring and the detection of suspicious behavior. The long-term recommendation is to consider using a blockchain-monitoring system to track any suspicious behavior in the contracts. A monitoring mechanism for critical events would quickly detect any compromised system components.

### Original Finding Content

## Vulnerability Report

## Difficulty: 
High

## Type: 
Configuration

## Target: 
`CrosslayerPortal/contracts/core/MosaicVault.sol`, `CrosslayerPortal/contracts/core/BridgeAggregator.sol`, `CrosslayerPortal/contracts/nfts/MosaicNFT.sol`

## Description
Several critical operations do not trigger events. As a result, it will be difficult to review the correct behavior of the contracts once they have been deployed. For example, the `setRelayer` function, which is called in the `MosaicVault` contract to set the relayer address, does not emit an event providing confirmation of that operation to the contract’s caller (see Figure 28.1).

```solidity
function setRelayer(address _relayer) external override onlyOwner {
    relayer = _relayer;
}
```
**Figure 28.1:** The `setRelayer()` function in `MosaicVault`:80-82

Without events, users and blockchain-monitoring systems cannot easily detect suspicious behavior.

## Exploit Scenario
Eve, an attacker, is able to take ownership of the `MosaicVault` contract. She then sets a new relayer address. Alice, a Composable Finance team member, is unaware of the change and does not raise a security incident.

## Recommendations
- **Short term:** Add events for all critical operations that result in state changes. Events aid in contract monitoring and the detection of suspicious behavior.
- **Long term:** Consider using a blockchain-monitoring system to track any suspicious behavior in the contracts. The system relies on several contracts to behave as expected. A monitoring mechanism for critical events would quickly detect any compromised system components.
