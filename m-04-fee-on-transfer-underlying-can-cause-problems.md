## Vulnerability Title

[M-04] fee-on-transfer underlying can cause problems

### Overview


This bug report is about a vulnerability in the current implementation of the Compound protocol that affects the transfer of underlying tokens. This issue arises when transferring tokens from the Swivel.sol contract, as it wrongly assumes the token balances. This could lead to users being blocked from redeeming the underlying tokens, which is particularly problematic if the token activates a fee. The proof of concept for this bug can be seen in the code given, which shows how the contract would fail when trying to transfer the underlying tokens back to the sender. The recommended mitigation step for this bug is to implement a way to check the balance of the contract before and after every token transfer, such as Compund's 'doTransferIn' function.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by 0xsanson_.

#### Impact

The current implementation doesn't work with fee-on-transfer underlying tokens. Considering that Compound can have these kind of tokens (ex. USDT can activate fees), this issue can affect the protocol.

The problem arises when transferring tokens, basically blocking all functions in `Swivel.sol` for that particular token, since the contract wrongly assumes balances values.
This becomes particularly problematic in the following scenario: a market for USDT is running without problems, then they activate the fee: this effectively blocks users from redeeming the underlying.

#### Proof of Concept

`grep 'transfer' Swivel.sol` for a complete list of affected lines (basically every `tranfer` or `transferFrom` of underlying tokens). Also `grep 'redeemUnderlying' Swivel.sol`.

For example:

```js
  require(CErc20(mPlace.cTokenAddress(u, m)).redeemUnderlying(redeemed) == 0, 'compound redemption failed');
  // transfer underlying back to msg.sender
  Erc20(u).transfer(msg.sender, redeemed);
```

This would fail (revert) since the contract would have received less than `redeemed` tokens.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If the protocol wants to use all possible Compound tokens, a way to handle these tokens must be implemented. A possible way to do it is to check the balance of the contract before and after every time a token is transferred to see the effective quantity. To help keeping the code clear, a function like [Compound's `doTransferIn`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CErc20.sol#L156) can be implemented.

> Will review further. I dont believe that any tokens on compound currently have fees. Although it *is* news to me that USDT has toggle-able fees, whoops.
> 
> That said, given we have admin control over added assets, I'd probably also lower this to a low-risk if accepted.

> 2 — Med: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.

> based on this "leaking value" I would say it qualifies as a med-severity. 

**[JTraversa (Swivel) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/156#issuecomment-950403433):**
 > We can account for the transfers in with a similar balance before transferFrom, and balance after check, in order to prevent additional deposits after a fee has been turned on.
> 
> That said, Im not sure we can account for `redeemUnderlying` easily because should a fee be turned on, all funds would just be stuck in our contract if we added a similar check? (a != balance2-balance1)
> 
> If a fee is turned on for USDT markets, there would be lost fee value, so if adding a check wouldn't work, the most reasonable response is just to make sure the market is pausable.
