## Vulnerability Title

[M-06] Fee-on-transfer and rebase tokens.

### Overview


This bug report discusses issues with the transfer of certain tokens in the codebase. These tokens include those that charge fees during transfers, have a 1 to 2 wei corner case, and rebase or give airdrops. These tokens can cause problems with the protocol's accounting and may result in lost tokens. The report recommends implementing measures to handle these tokens, such as checking contract balances before and after transfers and implementing a system to prevent loss of excess tokens. Alternatively, blocking these token types from being used as pool assets may also be a solution.

### Original Finding Content

**Severity**

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

**Description**

In various parts of the codebase, assets are transferred using with the assumption that the amount transferred, is the amount received. This however isn't the case when dealing with certain tokens.
i. Some charge a fee during transfers, e.g PAXG. Also important to note is that tokens like USDT also have the option to charge fees, but currently do not.
ii. Some tokens, notably stETH have a [1 to 2 wei corner case](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case), in which the amount received during a transfer is less than the amount specified.
iii. Some tokens rebase, both positively and negatively, in which the holder's balance overtime increases or decreases. stETH also does this. This also includes tokens that give airdrops and the likes.

These tokens have the ability to mess with the protocol's accounting if in use. This is because the transfer functions aren't optimized to handle them, and as a result can lead to situations in which the pools' asset balance will be way less than the amount expected and tracked. Here, the protocol will incur extra costs to cover for these situations.
Also, the tokens received from airdrops and positive rebases can be lost forever as there's no way to retrieve them.

The following are the functions affected.

1. NablaPortal.sol - `swapExactTokensForEth` #L234, `swapExactTokensForTokens` #L293

2. GenericPool.sol - `_processDeposit` #L96, `_processWithdrawal` #L118

3. BackstopPoolCore.sol - `_redeemSwapPoolShares` L466,

4. SawPool.sol - `backstopDrain` #L511, `swapIntoFromRouter` #L585, `swapOutFromRouter` #L670 #L675,

5. RouterCore.sol - `_executeSwap` #L230 #L245,

**Recommendations**

Before any token transfer, both in and out of the protocol, recommend checking the contract balance before and after, and registering the difference as the amount sent. This helps handle fee-on-transfer tokens, and the 1 wei corner cases.
For the rebasing tokens and variable balances, a system of balance tracking and excess token sweep functions can be implemented to periodically skim the excess tokens from the contrascts to prevent them from being lost.

Alternativly, explicitely blocklisting these token types to prevent them from being made pool assets.
