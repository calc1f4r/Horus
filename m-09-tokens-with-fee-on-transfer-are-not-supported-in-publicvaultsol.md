## Vulnerability Title

[M-09] Tokens with fee on transfer are not supported in `PublicVault.sol`

### Overview


This bug report is about a problem with the `PublicVault.sol` contract, which is part of the Astaria project. The issue is that some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. `STA`, `PAXG`), while others do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. `USDT`, `USDC`). If a fee-on-transfer token is added to the `PublicVault` contract, depositors will be unable to withdraw their rewards. This is because the current implementation assumes that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount, but due to how fee-on-transfer tokens work, much less will be received than what was transferred. This will cause later users to be unable to successfully withdraw their shares, as it may revert due to insufficient balance.

To demonstrate this, a proof of concept was provided. In this scenario, the contract calls a transfer of 100 tokens from contractA to the current contract. The current contract thinks it received 100 tokens, and updates balances to increase by +100 tokens. However, the contract actually only received 90 tokens, which breaks the math for the given token.

The recommended mitigation steps for this issue are to consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount, or to disallow tokens with fee-on-transfer mechanics to be added as tokens. The bug report was acknowledged by androolloyd (Astaria).

### Original Finding Content


Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. `STA`, `PAXG`), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. `USDT`, `USDC`).

Should a fee-on-transfer token be added to the `PublicVault`, the tokens will be locked in the `PublicVault.sol` contract. Depositors will be unable to withdraw their rewards.
In the current implementation, it is assumed that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount. However, due to how fee-on-transfer tokens work, much less will be received than what was transferred.

As a result, later users may not be able to successfully withdraw their shares, as it may revert at <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L148> when `WithdrawProxy` is called due to insufficient balance.

### Proof of Concept

i.e. Fee-on-transfer scenario:<br>
Contract calls transfer from contractA 100 tokens to current contract<br>
Current contract thinks it received 100 tokens<br>
It updates balances to increase +100 tokens<br>
While actually contract received only 90 tokens<br>
That breaks whole math for given token

```solidity
  function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver)
    public
    override(ERC4626Cloned)
    whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256)
  {
    VIData storage s = _loadVISlot();
    if (s.allowListEnabled) {
      require(s.allowList[receiver]);
    }

    uint256 assets = totalAssets();

    return super.deposit(amount, receiver);
  }
```

        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        uint64 epoch
      ) internal virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        // check to ensure that the requested epoch is not in the past

        ERC20Data storage es = _loadERC20Slot();

        if (msg.sender != owner) {
          uint256 allowed = es.allowance[owner][msg.sender]; // Saves gas for limited approvals.

          if (allowed != type(uint256).max) {
            es.allowance[owner][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;
          }
        }

        if (epoch < s.currentEpoch) {
          revert InvalidState(InvalidStates.EPOCH_TOO_LOW);
        }
        require((assets = previewRedeem(shares)) != 0, "ZERO_ASSETS");
        // check for rounding error since we round down in previewRedeem.

        //this will underflow if not enough balance
        es.balanceOf[owner] -= shares;

        // Cannot overflow because the sum of all user
        // balances can't exceed the max uint256 value.
        unchecked {
          es.balanceOf[address(this)] += shares;
        }

        emit Transfer(owner, address(this), shares);
        // Deploy WithdrawProxy if no WithdrawProxy exists for the specified epoch
        _deployWithdrawProxyIfNotDeployed(s, epoch);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        // WithdrawProxy shares are minted 1:1 with PublicVault shares
        WithdrawProxy(s.epochData[epoch].withdrawProxy).mint(shares, receiver);
      }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
2.  Alternatively, disallow tokens with fee-on-transfer mechanics to be added as tokens.
