## Vulnerability Title

Centralization risks

### Overview


This bug report discusses a vulnerability in several contracts that allow the admin to change important state variables at any time, which could potentially be exploited by a malicious admin. This could lead to unintended bugs or changes to the contracts without users noticing. The report recommends using a multisig wallet or a secure governance mechanism to prevent this vulnerability. The team plans to implement a multisig wallet and a governance mechanism in the future to address this issue.

### Original Finding Content

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In ComptrollerNFTPart1 contract, The functions `_setNFTCollateralFactor()`, `_setNFTCollateralSeizeLiquidationFactor()`, `_setNFTCollateralLiquidationBonusPBX()`, `_setNFTLiquidationExchangePToken()`, `_setNFTXioMarketplaceZapAddress()`, `_setSudoswapPairRouterAddress()`, `_setUniswapV3SwapRouterAddress()`, `_setUniswapWETHAddress()`, `_setNFTModuleClosedBeta()` can be used to change important state variables anytime by the admin. This can lead to unintended bugs if exploited by a malicious admin. 
ComptrollerNFT contracts (including ComptrollerNFTPart1 and ComptrollerNFTPart2) can be changed anytime by the admin. Moreover, the Unitroller address and its implementation, once tied with the ComptrollerNFT contracts (using _become from  ComptrollerNoNFTCommonImpl) can be changed anytime by an admin using _become function again. This can lead to a malicious or compromised admin making malicious changes to the Comptroller and Unitroller contracts without the user's noticing.
Similarly in the ComptrollerNoNFTPart1 contract, the functions: `_setPriceOracle()`, `_setCloseFactor()`, `_setCollateralFactor()`, `_setLiquidationIncentive()`, `_setBorrowCapGuardian()` and `_setPauseGuardian()` can be used to change important state variables anytime by the admin.
Also in the PNFTToken contract, the functions `_setComptroller()`, `_setNFTXioVaultId()` and `_setSudoswapLSSVMPairAddress()` can be used to change the state variables anytime by a malicious admin to exploit the contract.
In the PNFTTokenDelegator contract, the `_setImplementation()` can be used to change the implementation of the contract to a malicious one by a compromised admin.
Similarly the above issue is applicable to the PToken, Governance and Interest rate model contracts. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to utilize at least a 2/3 or a 3/5 Multisig wallet used by different trusted participants or use a secure governance mechanism to decentralize its usage.

**Comments**: The team would be using a multisign wallet (Gnosis Safe) now.  They said that they would be using a governance mechanism in futuew, known from Compound, where users will be able to vote for update proposals. Here the admin address for the contracts they said will be set to the governance contract in the future.
