## Vulnerability Title

[M-03] The `owner` is a single point of failure and a centralization risk

### Overview


This bug report is about a centralization risk and a single point of failure in the code of a project called Venus. In the code, there are three instances of this issue. The issue is that a single EOA (External Owned Account) is the only owner of contracts, which is a large centralization risk and a single point of failure. This means that if the private key is taken in a hack, or the sole holder of the key is unable to retrieve the key when necessary, it can cause serious issues. The solution proposed is to change to a multi-signature setup, or have a role-based authorization model.

The project, Venus, has safeguards in place to ensure decentralization is achieved through governance. However, the potentiality of centralization risks must be highlighted from the user perspective. The severity of the risk was determined to be medium.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by [Tera Bot](https://gist.github.com/code423n4/9e80eddfb29953d8b5a424084a54e4ed?permalink_comment_id=4762845#m01-the-owner-is-a-single-point-of-failure-and-a-centralization-risk)_

_Note: this finding was reported via the winning [Automated Findings report](https://gist.github.com/code423n4/9e80eddfb29953d8b5a424084a54e4ed). It was declared out of scope for the audit, but is being included here for completeness._

Having a single EOA as the only owner of contracts is a large centralization risk and a single point of failure. A single private key may be taken in a hack, or the sole holder of the key may become unable to retrieve the key when necessary. Consider changing to a multi-signature setup, or having a role-based authorization model.

 >Regarding [M‑03] The owner is a single point of failure and a centralization risk, the owner won't be an EOA, but that cannot be specified in the solidity code. The owner of our contracts is always the Normal Timelock contract deployed at 0x939bD8d64c0A9583A7Dcea9933f7b21697ab6396. This contract is used in the Governance process, so after a voting period of 24 hours, and an extra delay of 48 hours if the vote passed, this contract will execute the commands agreed on the Venus Improvement Proposal.

 >Confirming medium severity for centralization risk, though Venus does has safeguards in place to ensure that decentralization is achieved through governance. From a user-perspective, the potentiality of centralization risks must be highlighted.
