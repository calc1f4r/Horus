## Vulnerability Title

REENTRANCY LEADS DRAIN OF FUNDS (PRIVILEGED USER)

### Overview


The report describes a bug in the LiquidityPool contract where a malicious owner or liquidity provider can drain all funds from the pool. This is known as a Reentrancy vulnerability and it can be exploited to steal funds from the contract. The steps to reproduce the bug include deploying the contract, transferring funds to it, and then setting up a malicious attack contract to drain the funds. The bug has been classified as critical and a fix has been implemented by the Biconomy team.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description

The Reentrancy term comes from where a re-entrant procedure can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution. In Solidity, Reentrancy vulnerabilities are mostly critical because attackers can steal funds from contracts by exploiting this vulnerability.

It has been observed that a malicious owner or malicious liquidity provider can drain all funds from the liquidity pool.

**Note:** The risk level is decreased to `Critical` from `High` due to authorization level.

`Steps to Reproduce:`

1. Alice (owner) deploys the LiquidityPool contract.
2. Bob (user1) transfer some funds (22 ETH) to LiquidityPool.
3. Carol (user2) transfer more funds (15 ETH) to LiquidityPool.
4. Alice deploys a malicious Attack contract.
5. Alice sets LiquidityProviders address to the attack contact.
6. Alice tries to send (1 ETH) to the attack contract.
7. Attack contract calls LiquidityPool's transfer function reentrantly.
8. Attack contract consumes all ETH from LiquidityPool.
9. Alice destructs the Attack contract and gets all ETH.

            require(baseToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _tokenAmount, "ERR__INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE");
            SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransfer(baseToken, receiver, _tokenAmount);
        }
    }

```

##### Score

Impact: 5  
Likelihood: 3

##### Recommendation

**SOLVED:** The `Biconomy team` solved this issue by implementing `nonReentrant` modifier to the `transfer()` function.
