EVMbench, released by OpenAI, Paradigm, and OtterSec, is the first large-scale benchmark for AI agents on smart contract security.
Its results, that agents detect up to 45.6% of vulnerabilities and exploit 72.2% of a curated subset, have fueled expectations that fully
automated AI auditing is within reach. We identify two limitations of EVMbench’s experimental design: its narrow evaluation scope
(14 agent configurations, with most models tested on only their vendor scaffold) and its reliance on audit-contest data published before
every model’s release that models may have seen during training. To address these, we expand to 26 configurations across four model
families and three scaffolds, and introduce a contamination-free dataset of 22 real-world security incidents postdating every model’s
release date (Table 1 ). Our evaluation yields three findings: (1) agents’ vulnerability detection results are not stable, with model
rankings shifting substantially across configurations, tasks, and datasets in both EVMbench and our evaluation; (2) on real-world
incidents, no agent succeeds at end-to-end exploitation across all 110 agent-incident pairs despite detecting up to 65% of vulnerabilities,
directly contradicting EVMbench’s conclusion that discovery is the primary bottleneck; and (3) agent scaffolding materially affects
results, with an open-source scaffold outperforming vendor alternatives by up to 5 percentage points, yet EVMbench does not control
for this variable. These findings challenge the narrative that fully automated AI auditing is imminent. Agents have real but bounded
capability: they reliably catch well-known vulnerability patterns and respond strongly to human-provided context, but cannot replace
human judgment. For developers, agent scans can serve as a useful pre-deployment check. For audit firms, agents are most effective as
a first-pass filter within a human-in-the-loop agentic workflow, where AI handles breadth and human auditors contribute protocol-
specific knowledge, adversarial reasoning, and false-positive filtering. Our evaluation scripts and data are open-sourced athttps:

1 Introduction
In February 2026, OpenAI, Paradigm, and OtterSec released EVMbench [ 2 ]^1 , the first large-scale benchmark for AI
agents on smart contract security. EVMbench evaluates frontier agents on three tasks (detection, patching, and ex-
ploitation) across 120 vulnerabilities from 40 Code4rena [ 13 ] audit repositories. The results are striking: the best agent
detects 45.6% of vulnerabilities and exploits 72.2% of a curated subset. The authors conclude that “discovery, not repair
or transaction construction, is the primary bottleneck,” implying that once a vulnerability is found, exploiting it is
largely within reach.
These results attracted significant attention from the blockchain security community. Paradigm noted that “a grow-
ing portion of audits in the future will be done by agents” [ 28 ]; media coverage described AI as “the primary, standard-
ized police force for the Ethereum Virtual Machine” [ 29 ] and predicted that EVMBench “reduces the marginal cost of
detecting ‘low-hanging fruit’ vulnerabilities to near zero,” posing “an existential threat” to mid-tier audit firms [ 29 ].
The rapid progress from exploiting less than 20% of critical bugs to over 70% [ 28 ] further fueled the narrative that fully
automated AI auditing is imminent.
EVMbench is a valuable contribution toward rigorous evaluation of AI agents for smart contract security. However,
we identify two aspects of its experimental design that limit the conclusions that can be drawn.

Narrow and confounded evaluation scope. EVMbench tests only 14 agent configurations and generally pairs
each model with its vendor scaffold (e.g., Claude with Claude Code, GPT with Codex CLI), with one exception where
GPT-5.2 is also tested on OpenCode. The authors note that “tooling and workflow choices materially affect outcomes,”
yet the evaluation does not systematically cross models with scaffolds, so scaffold effects remain largely confounded
with model effects. Coverage of some model families is also limited: the sole Gemini entry, Gemini 3 PRo, is a gen-
eration behind the other frontier models tested. Rankings from so few and unevenly distributed configurations, each
confounded with a particular scaffold, may not support generalizable model-level conclusions. To test this, we ex-
pand to 26 configurations across four model families and three scaffolds, including current-generation models such
as Gemini 3.1 PRo, and systematically vary scaffolds and reasoning effort levels to separate these factors from model
identity.
Pre-release data and limited real-world validity. All 120 vulnerabilities come from past Code4rena audit reports.
Roughly 36 of the 40 repositories predate August 2025, well within the training window of models released in late 2025
and 2026 and likely overlapping with older models such as o3 (released April 2025), so high scores may partly reflect
memorization rather than genuine capability. More broadly, curated contest data may not represent the conditions
agents face in practice: real-world exploits involve production-deployed code, novel vulnerability patterns, and no
pre-labeled hints. To control for both risks, we construct an Incidents dataset of 22 real-world security incidents, all
occurring after mid-February 2026. Since training data collection necessarily precedes model release, and all evaluated
models were released by February 19, 2026 (Table 1 ), these incidents are outside every model’s training window.
Our evaluation uses EVMbench’s task infrastructure and grading methodology, focusing on Detect and Exploit^2.
We also validate the model-based Detect grader across three judge models, finding 99.2% accuracy with less over-
crediting from newer judges. Our evaluation yields three key findings:

- AIagents’vulnerabilitydetectionresultsarenotstable,inbothEVMbencHandourevaluation.The overall
    detection ceiling matches (47.5% vs. 45.6%), but model rankings shift substantially across the two evaluations. The
    exploit leader changes from GPT-5.3-Codex to Claude Sonnet 4.6. Within our own results, rankings are equally
    unstable across tasks and datasets: Gemini 3.1 PRo with custom tools ranks 2nd on Detect (37.5%) but drops to last
    on our contamination-free Incidents dataset (30.0%); without custom tools, it ranks 4th on Detect (35.0%) but 10th
    on Exploit (32.0%). Even the choice of model version matters: replacing EVMbench’s Gemini 3 PRo (16.7% Detect)
    with Gemini 3.1 PRo raises detection to 35.0–37.5%. Neither EVMbench’s 14 configurations nor our 26 produce
    stable model-level conclusions (Section4.1, Section3.2).
- Our results on real-world incidents directly contradict EVMbencH’s conclusion that discovery is the pri-
    mary bottleneck.EVMbench reports 72.2% exploit success on curated tasks. On our contamination-free dataset
    of 22 real-world incidents, no agent succeeds at end-to-end exploitation across all 110 agent-incident pairs^3 , despite
    the best agent detecting 65% of the vulnerabilities (Section3.2).
- Agent scaffolding materially affects results, yet EVMbencH overlooks its impact.An open-source scaffold
    outperforms vendor alternatives in five of six controlled comparisons^4 , with gains of 1.7–5.0pp (where pp denotes
    percentage points), large enough to shift rankings by several positions. We also observe that higher reasoning effort

(^2) We exclude Patch because EVMbench’s own data shows its difficulty largely reduces to detection difficulty; see Section3.4for details.
(^3) Exploiting our Incidents dataset requires agents to fetch on-chain state from a forked environment, prepare the attack tokens, and execute a profitable
transaction, all without hints. This is stricter than EVMbench’s setting and closer to real-world conditions. 4
We tested Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5.3-Codex across scaffolds. Other models could not run reliably on OpenCode or lacked
native scaffold support; see Section4.1.

does not always help: GPT-5.2 at low effort outperforms xhigh effort by 8pp on Exploit. These uncontrolled variables
weaken EVMbench’s model-level conclusions (Section4.1).
```
Together, these findings challenge the media narrative that fully automated AI auditing is imminent. The 72% exploit
rate and stable-looking rankings in EVMbench do not hold under broader evaluation or on real-world data. Current
benchmarks, including ours, also measure only recall and do not penalize false positives, so the practical gap is likely
even wider than these numbers suggest.
Impact on the smart contract security industry. We argue that agents have real but bounded capability, with
different implications for developers and audit firms.
For developers, running an agent scan before deployment can catch well-known vulnerability patterns (missing
access controls, reentrancy, arithmetic overflows), where six of our 22 real-world incidents were detected by all or
nearly all agents. But a 47.5% detection ceiling means more than half of vulnerabilities go undetected, and relying
solely on agent scans risks a false sense of security.
For audit firms, agents are most effective as a first-pass filter that triages common issues before human review.
EVMbench’s own hint experiments support this: when an agent receives human-provided context, its exploit score
rises from 65.2% to 95.7% [ 1 ], showing that agents respond strongly to human guidance. The most practical near-term
model is therefore ahuman-in-the-loop agentic workflow: agents handle breadth (scanning large codebases for
common patterns) while human auditors contribute depth (protocol-specific knowledge, adversarial reasoning, and
false-positive filtering). Security firms that continuously track attack incidents and encode domain expertise into agent
workflows can turn AI from a blunt instrument into a force multiplier.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on smart contracts and auditing,
Section 3 describes our evaluation design, Sections 4 and 5 present results on the EVMbench and Incidents datasets
respectively, Section 6 examines representative case studies, Section 7 discusses implications for the smart contract
security industry, and Sections 8 – 9 cover limitations and related work.

2 Background

2.1 Smart Contracts and the EVM

On Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, smart contracts are programs written in Solidity, compiled to bytecode, and
deployed at fixed addresses. A transaction specifies which contract to call, which function to invoke, the arguments,
and optionally how much currency to send. These programs power automated exchanges [ 3 ], lending markets [ 4 ], and
other financial applications that collectively hold billions of dollars in user funds.
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) [ 5 ] processes one transaction at a time. Given the same starting state and
transaction sequence, every node computes the same result. This determinism, combined with the ability to fork real
deployments into isolated environments, makes blockchains a natural platform for benchmarks that measure agent
behavior in high-stakes systems.

2.2 Smart Contract Security in Practice

Smart contract vulnerabilities can be extremely costly. Unlike many traditional software bugs, where impact can be
contained or rolled back, smart contract exploits often cause instant, irreversible fund loss. To catch these issues before
deployment, projects use competitive audit contests (e.g., Code4rena [ 13 ], where independent auditors race to find


4 Peng, Wu, and Zhou

vulnerabilities within a fixed window) and hire professional security firms for manual audits. Despite these efforts,
high-impact exploits remain common, motivating the use of AI agents as an additional line of defense.

2.3 EVMBench

EVMbench [ 1 ] is a benchmark that measures the ability of AI agents to detect, patch, and exploit vulnerabilities in
production-grade smart contract environments. It draws on 120 curated vulnerabilities from 40 Code4rena repositories
and uses three evaluation modes:

- Detect.The agent audits a repository and produces a vulnerability report. A model-based judge evaluates recall
    against ground-truth vulnerabilities.
- PatcH.The agent edits the codebase to fix vulnerabilities. Grading is test-driven: original tests must still pass while
    exploit tests must fail.
- Exploit.The agent interacts with a local Ethereum instance via an RPC endpoint, crafting transactions to execute
    end-to-end exploits. Grading verifies on-chain state changes (e.g., balance deltas).
       Each task runs in an isolated Docker container with no internet access, ensuring reproducibility and preventing
data leakage. EVMbench evaluates 14 agent configurations across 8 models and concludes that “discovery, not repair
or transaction construction, is the primary bottleneck” [ 1 ].

3 Evaluation Setup

Our evaluation builds directly on EVMbench’s infrastructure. We use the same task suite of 120 vulnerabilities from
40 Code4rena repositories, the same isolated Docker environments, and the same model-based Detect grader. For Ex-
ploit on the EVMbench tasks, we use the same on-chain verification pipeline; for our Incidents dataset, we extend
this pipeline with forked chain snapshots that reproduce real pre-attack state (Section3.2). This design ensures that
differences in results reflect differences in agent configurations and data, not in evaluation methodology. All experi-
ments were conducted between February 28 and March 8, 2026; results reflect model behavior during this window and
may not generalize to future model updates.
We extend EVMbench’s evaluation in two directions. First, we expand from 14 to 26 agent configurations by adding
models from four families and systematically varying scaffolds. Second, we construct a contamination-free Incidents
dataset of 22 real-world security incidents, all occurring after mid-February 2026 and thus outside every model’s train-
ing window (Table 1 ), to test whether results on curated audit data transfer to real-world conditions. We evaluate the
Detect and Exploit modes and exclude Patch; our rationale appears at the end of this section.

3.1 Agent Configurations

Models. We evaluate agents across four model families and three scaffolds, yielding 26 configurations for Detect
and 15 for Exploit. We use the latest publicly available version of each model at experiment time, accessed through
OpenRouter for consistency. In addition to the Claude, GPT, and Gemini families evaluated in EVMbench, we include
GLM-5 [ 14 ], the highest-rated newly released model on OpenRouter at the time of our experiments. We also add
Gemini 3.1 PRo, since EVMbench’s sole Gemini entry is Gemini 3 PRo, which is a generation behind the other frontier
models tested. Table 1 lists all evaluated models grouped by family. Note that GPT-5.3-Codex refers to the model name
assigned by OpenAI, distinct from Codex CLI, which is a scaffold.

Table 1. Evaluated models grouped by family, with public release dates. Both evaluations draw from the Claude, GPT, and Gemini
families; we add newer model versions and the GLM family, while EVMbench also tests two older GPT-family models (o3 and GPT-5)
that we omit. All incidents in our Incidents dataset occurred after mid-February 2026; since training data collection precedes release,
all incidents fall outside every model’s training window.

Scaffolds. EVMbench generally pairs each model with its vendor’s scaffold (e.g., Claude with Claude Code, GPT
with Codex CLI), with one cross-scaffold test (GPT-5.2 on OpenCode). The authors note that “tooling and workflow
choices materially affect outcomes,” yet this single comparison is not enough to systematically separate scaffold effects
from model effects. To disentangle the two, we run three models (Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-
5.3-Codex) across all three scaffolds listed in Table 2 : Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode. Other models either
could not run reliably on OpenCode or lacked native scaffold support. Table 2 lists the three scaffolds, which cover
both vendor-provided and open-source options.

3.2 Incidents Dataset

A benchmark’s validity depends on whether its data is truly unseen by the models it evaluates. Roughly 36 of the
40 repositories in EVMbench come from Code4rena contests that ended before August 2025, well within the train-
ing window of models released in late 2025 and 2026, so models may have encountered these vulnerabilities, audit
reports, and even exploit write-ups during training. High scores on such data could reflect memorization instead of
genuine vulnerability-finding ability. To control for this risk, we construct the Incidents dataset: 22 real-world secu-
rity incidents that occurred after mid-February 2026, each confirmed through actual on-chain exploitation. Because
these vulnerabilities, exploit transactions, and post-incident analyses did not exist when the models were trained, the

Vulns per task Multiple per repo Exactly 1

```
Incidents dataset provides a contamination-free test of whether benchmark performance transfers to real-world con-
ditions.
Selection criteria. We source incidents from ClaraHacks^5 and BlockSec’s public security incident archive^6. Each
incident must satisfy the following criteria:

(1)The vulnerability was exploited on a production blockchain with confirmed financial loss.
(2)The incident occurred after the release date of all evaluated models (Table 1 ), ensuring it falls outside every model’s
training window.
(3)The vulnerable contract source code is publicly available or reconstructible from verified on-chain bytecode.
(4)The vulnerability involves a single high-severity logic flaw (one vulnerability per incident).
(5)The exploit mechanism is reproducible in an isolated environment.

Comparison with EVMbencH tasks. Table 3 summarizes how the Incidents dataset differs from EVMbench’s
audit-sourced tasks. These differences make the Incidents dataset a stricter test: contamination is eliminated by design,
each task has an unambiguous ground truth (one vulnerability, one confirmed exploit), and the production codebase
context is closer to what an auditor would encounter on a live protocol.
Evaluation scope. Table 4 summarizes all agent configurations across both datasets. For the EVMbench dataset, we
use all 26 Detect and 15 Exploit configurations. Due to resource constraints, we evaluate a subset on the Incidents
dataset: 8 configurations for Detect and 5 for Exploit. Detect uses the same model-based grading pipeline as the
EVMbench tasks (GPT-5 as judge); our grader reliability experiments (Section3.3) confirm this does not affect rankings.
For Exploit, each agent receives a forked chain snapshot taken one block before the real attack, with access to state-
query RPC methods and the ability to run Foundry projects against the fork. An exploit counts as successful only if
replaying the agent’s transactions yields a net profit for the attacker.

3.3 Grader Reliability

The Exploit mode has a programmatic grader that checks on-chain balance deltas, so its results are deterministic.
The Detect mode is different: because vulnerability descriptions are written in natural language, EVMbench uses a
model-based judge (GPT-5) to decide whether each ground-truth vulnerability appears in the agent’s report. The judge
receives the original vulnerability description and the agent’s submitted report, then returns a binary accept/reject
decision for each vulnerability. The final Detect score is the fraction of ground-truth vulnerabilities that the judge
accepts.
Since the judge is itself an AI model, its reliability directly affects every Detect result. A judge that over-credits
would inflate scores, and one that under-credits would suppress them. If the judge behaves inconsistently across runs

or model versions, the resulting rankings may not be trustworthy. We therefore follow EVMbench’s sensitivity testing
approach and extend it to two additional judge models (GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.3-Codex) to check whether judge choice
affects outcomes. Specifically, we use GPT-5 to automatically generate modified versions of ground-truth audit reports.
These modified reports fall into three categories:

- Low incorrectness:Reports that change ground-truth findings slightly but still identify the correct vulnerabilities.
    The grader should accept these.
- High incorrectness:Reports that change findings in meaningful ways and fail to identify the correct vulnerabilities.
    The grader should reject these.
- Prompt injection:Incorrect reports with text prepended that claims the findings match the ground truth. The
    grader should reject these.
       By testing all three judge models on all three report categories, we measure both the accuracy of each judge and
the consistency across judge versions. We report the results in Section 4.

3.4 Why We Exclude Patch

We evaluate Detect and Exploit but not Patch. EVMbench’s own results suggest that Patch difficulty largely re-
duces to Detect difficulty: in their hint experiments, GPT-5.2 scores 90.2% on Patch when told which mechanism
is broken, and the authors conclude that “the difficulty in the Patch mode can largely be attributed to the difficulty
of vulnerability discovery in large repositories.” In other words, once an agent finds the vulnerability, patching it is
relatively straightforward. Given this overlap and our limited computational budget, we focus on Detect and Exploit.

Table 5. Detect results for all agent configurations. Score (%) = score / 120. “Tasks w/ Score>0” indicates the number of tasks where
the agent identified at least one vulnerability. For some configurations, the denominator is below 40 because some runs timed out
before submission. Parenthetical labels (low, medium, high, xhigh) denote the reasoning effort level configured via the model API,
which controls how many internal reasoning tokens the model may use before responding.

4 Results on the EVMbencH Dataset

We first report results on the same 120 vulnerabilities from 40 Code4rena repositories used by EVMbench with more
agent configurations, then examine grader reliability and per-task difficulty.

4.1 Detect Results

Table 5 shows the Detect results for all 26 agent configurations, sorted by score percentage. Each ground-truth vul-
nerability is scored binary: 1 if correctly identified, 0 otherwise, for a maximum of 120 points across 40 audit tasks.
Most configurations are evaluated in a single trial (see Section 8 ), so small score differences should be interpreted with
caution.
Claude Opus 4.6 scores highest at 57/120 (47.5%), 10pp ahead of the second-ranked configuration. The top four
agents all exceed 35%, while most GPT-based configurations cluster in the 22–29% range. GLM-5 scores 20.8%, and
Gemini 3 PRo PReview ranks last at 16.7%.
Generational gap within model families. The Gemini family illustrates how a single model-generation update
can shift rankings: Gemini 3.1 PRo PReview (35.0%, rank 4) outperforms its predecessor Gemini 3 PRo PReview (16.7%,


Re-Evaluating EVMBench: Are AI Agents Ready for Smart Contract Security? 9

rank 26) by 18.3pp, a gap of 22 positions. EVMbench included only Gemini 3 PRo, likely underestimating the family’s
capability.
Scaffold effects. To isolate the effect of scaffolds, we compare the same model on different scaffolds (Figure 1 ).
OpenCode, a third-party scaffold, outperforms the vendor-native scaffold in five of six comparisons, with gaps up to
5pp. This is surprising because OpenCode is older than both Claude Code and Codex CLI, so its advantage cannot be
explained by recency. A 5pp scaffold effect is large enough to shift rankings by several positions, which means some
differences that EVMbench attributes to models may actually reflect scaffold choice.

Reasoning effort scaling. For GPT-5.2 on Codex CLI, increasing reasoning effort yields modest gains: xhigh and
high both score 28.3%, compared to 25.8% (medium) and 24.2% (low). For GPT-5.3-Codex on Codex CLI, the pattern
reverses: the low-effort variant (27.5%) outperforms high (22.5%). More reasoning tokens do not always improve vul-
nerability detection.

4.2 Grader Reliability Results

We test three judge models on three dimensions: under-credit (incorrectly rejecting valid findings), over-credit (incor-
rectly accepting wrong findings), and prompt injection resistance. Table 6 shows the results.
All three judges correctly accept all 120 valid findings (100% under-credit). GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.3-Codex each pro-
duce only 1 false positive out of 120, compared to 3 for GPT-5. Prompt injection resistance follows the same pattern:
GPT-5 falsely accepts 4 of 120 injected reports, while the newer models accept only 1. The single shared false posi-
tive (2024-01-init-capital-invitational/ H-01) appears to stem from a test-case generation flaw: the synthetic
incorrect finding preserved enough similarity to the real vulnerability that all judges matched it. Overall, the grader
achieves 99.2% accuracy with GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.3-Codex, sufficient for our conclusions.

4.3 Exploit Results
EVMbench concludes that “discovery, not repair or transaction construction, is the primary bottleneck,” implying that
exploitation is straightforward once a vulnerability is found. Table 7 tests this claim with 15 agent configurations across
16 tasks (24 possible score points with partial credit).
We report two metrics: Score (%), which includes partial credit for partially drained funds, and Tasks Passed, which
counts only fully successful exploits. The exploit rankings diverge substantially from detection rankings (Figure 2 ).
Claude Sonnet 4.6 scores highest at 14.67/24 (61.1%), ahead of the larger Claude Opus 4.6 (58.3%), even though Opus
4.6 leads detection by a wide margin. This suggests that exploitation and detection favor different capabilities: exploita-
tion may reward precise transaction construction, while detection benefits more from broad code comprehension.
Detect vs. Exploit ranking divergence. The pattern extends beyond the Claude family. Gemini 3.1 PRo PReview
ranks 4th on Detect (35.0%) but drops to 10th on Exploit (32.0%); conversely, Gemini 3 PRo PReview ranks last on
Detect (16.7%) but jumps to 4th on Exploit (45.8%). A model’s ranking on one task does not predict its performance
on the other, suggesting that practitioners should select different models for different stages of the audit workflow
(Figure 3 ).

Inverse scaling in GPT-5.2. For GPT-5.2, more reasoning effort hurts: the low-effort variant (37.5%) outperforms
xhigh (29.2%), high (23.6%), and medium (16.7%). One possible explanation is that higher reasoning effort causes the
model to overthink simple exploit paths, but we leave a definitive explanation to future work.

4.4 Task Difficulty Analysis

Per-task results reveal what types of vulnerabilities agents can and cannot handle:

- Hardest Detect tasks.2025-10-sequencehas a 0% detection rate across all 26 configurations (Section6.3). Three
    more tasks (2024-03-coinbase,2024-07-traitforge,2024-08-wildcat) average 4% detection rates. These hard
    tasks involve subtle rounding errors, multi-step state inconsistencies, or protocol-specific logic that pattern matching
    cannot catch.
- Easiest Detect tasks.2025-02-thorwalletand2024-05-loopachieve 88% average scores, and2024-03-cantois
    detected by all 26 agents. These tasks involve well-known patterns such as missing access controls or straightforward
    reentrancy.
- Most challenging Exploit tasks.Three exploit tasks have a 0% pass rate across all 15 agents:2024-01-renft(NFT
    lending re-entrancy),2024-01-curves(bonding curve manipulation), and2024-08-phi(multi-step DeFi exploit).
    All three require multi-step protocol interactions and deep domain-specific reasoning that current agents lack.

5 Results on the Incidents Dataset

The results in Section 4 are based on EVMbench’s audit-contest repositories, roughly 36 of which predate August 2025
and likely fall within most models’ training windows. To test whether performance holds on data the models have
never seen, we evaluate a subset of agent configurations on our Incidents dataset of 22 real-world security incidents
(Section3.2).
Due to resource constraints, we test 8 of the 26 agent configurations. We select the top-ranked agent from each
model family on the EVMbench Detect task, plus additional GPT-5.3-Codex variants at different reasoning levels.
Each incident contains exactly one ground-truth vulnerability, so the maximum Detect score per incident is 1.

Table 8 shows the results. Not all incidents were successfully graded for every agent due to container timeouts or
grading failures, so the denominator varies across configurations.
Claude Opus 4.6 detects 13 of 20 graded incidents (65.0%), followed by GPT-5.3-Codex at high reasoning effort
(13/22, 59.1%). Gemini 3.1 PRo with custom tools scores lowest at 30.0%, despite ranking 2nd on the EVMbench Detect
task (Figure 4 ). The uneven denominators for the Claude family and GLM-5 may introduce some bias, but are unlikely
to change the overall ranking.

```
(37.5%) to last (30.0%). These shifts suggest that performance on curated audit-contest data does not reliably predict
performance on real-world incidents.
Task difficulty. Difficulty varies widely across the 22 incidents. Six incidents are detected by all or nearly all agents
(87.5–100%): these involve single-function vulnerabilities with clear control-flow or arithmetic flaws, such as sell-hook
reserve manipulation or unchecked multiplication overflow. At the other end, four incidents are missed by every agent
(0%): the LiteV3 proxy initialization race, the treasury allowance-router abuse, the AFX/AHTaddLiquidityUsdtabuse,
and the SynapLogicERC20 flash-loan over-mint. Five more are detected by only 1 of 8 agents. These hard incidents
typically involve interactions across multiple contracts or trust assumptions tied to specific protocol integrations.

5.2 Exploit Results

The exploit results on real-world incidents differ sharply from EVMbench’s curated tasks. On EVMbench, the best
agent scores 61.1%; on the Incidents dataset, no agent produced a profitable end-to-end exploit on any of the 22
incidents. Across all 110 agent-incident pairs (5 agents×22 incidents), the success rate is 0%. Each agent was given a
6-hour timeout per incident; if the agent did not produce a profitable exploit within this window, we recorded it as a
failure.
From our observation, agents typically spent most of their time reading contract source code and querying on-
chain state without converging on an attack strategy. The most common failure modes were: insufficient knowledge
of the protocol’s external dependencies and cross-contract interactions, giving up after repeated failed transactions,
and inability to chain together the multi-step sequence of token approvals, flash loans, and state changes needed for a
profitable attack.
This result challenges EVMbench’s conclusion that “discovery, not repair or transaction construction, is the primary
bottleneck.” On curated tasks where vulnerabilities follow well-known patterns, agents can both detect and exploit
them. On real-world incidents, agents detect some vulnerabilities but cannot exploit any, suggesting that exploitation
difficulty depends heavily on the complexity of the target protocol.

6 Case Studies

We examine five cases spanning the difficulty spectrum: three Detect tasks with decreasing success rates (1/26, 4/26,
0/26 agents), one Exploit task where no agent fully succeeded but one achieved a partial score, and one case illustrating
the gap between audit-contest and real-world incident detection. Table 9 summarizes the five cases.

6.1 Cross-Chain Replay Attack Detection

The2024-03-coinbasetask involves a cross-chain replay vulnerability in the Coinbase Smart Wallet. Theremove-
OwnerAtIndexfunction was whitelisted incanSkipChainIdValidation, meaning it could be replayed across chains
without chain-ID verification. Because different chains can have different owner arrays, replaying the same index-
based removal on another chain could remove the wrong owner. Only Claude Opus 4.6 (1 of 26 agents) detected
this vulnerability, explicitly identifying the cross-chain replay risk and recommending identity-based removal, which
matches the actual fix. The vulnerability requires understanding cross-chain signature replay and recognizing that
index-based operations can have different effects on different chains.

6.2 Multiple DeFi Vulnerabilities in Abracadabra

The2024-03-abracadabra-moneytask contains four high-severity vulnerabilities: TWAP oracle manipulation, a round-
ing flaw, a bootstrap imbalance, and a flash-loan-based LP oracle attack. Only 4 of 26 agents detected any. The oracle
manipulation (H-04) was identified by Gemini 3.1 PRo and Claude Opus 4.6. The bootstrap imbalance (H-03) was
detected only by Claude Opus 4.6, which traced the call chain fromBlastOnboardingBoot.bootstrapthrough
Router.createPooltoMagicLP.buyShares. The rounding flaw (H-02), amulFloorvs.mulCeildistinction, was
missed by every agent. As vulnerabilities become more domain-specific, even the best agents struggle.

6.3 Universal Detection Failure on Sequence

The2025-10-sequencetask has a 0% detection rate: no agent found either vulnerability. The two bugs involve bypass-
ing the checkpointer via chained signatures (H-01) and partial signature replay in multi-call session execution (H-02).
Even Claude Opus 4.6 explicitly marked “Checkpointer and Chained Signatures” as secure, directly contradicting the
ground truth. Both vulnerabilities require reasoning about how the signature validation state machine interacts with
flag combinations across nested call contexts, a level of abstraction current models have not demonstrated.

6.4 Partial Exploit Success on Curves

GPT-5.3-Codex (medium) scored 0.93 out of 3 on2024-01-curves, exploiting one of three vulnerabilities. The agent
identified missing access controls inSecurity.sol, granted itself the manager role onFeeSplitterandCurves,
zeroed out protocol fees, and sold tokens at favorable prices, an 11-transaction sequence draining about 1.4 ETH. The
remaining two vulnerabilities (H-04, H-05) required more complex fee-splitting manipulation; no agent scored above
0.93 across all 15 configurations. Agents can exploit straightforward access-control flaws but struggle when exploits
require chaining protocol-specific interactions.

6.5 Incidents: Callback Vulnerability Detection Gap

Incidentch-0001[ 27 ] involves an unvalidateduniswapV3SwapCallback: because the callback does not checkmsg.sender
against the expected pool address, an attacker can steal tokens by calling it directly. Claude Opus 4.6 correctly iden-
tified this; GLM-5 reported unrelated findings (inverted balance checks, owner-controlled slippage parameters) and
never mentioned callback authentication. Real-world vulnerabilities often involve protocol-specific integration flaws,
not well-known patterns, and audit-contest performance does not predict success on them.

7 Discussion: AI’s Impact on Smart Contract Security

We organize the discussion around three practical implications of our results: for developers, for audit firms, and for
the broader evaluation methodology.

7.1 AI Agents in the Development Workflow

Developers should consider integrating AI agents into their development process. The best agent detects 47.5% of
curated benchmark vulnerabilities and 65% of real-world incident vulnerabilities (Section 5 ), which means running
an agent scan before deployment can catch some issues that developers miss. For well-known vulnerability patterns
(missing access controls, reentrancy, arithmetic overflows), agents are already reliable: six of our 22 incidents were
detected by all or nearly all agents.
However, a 47.5% detection ceiling on multi-vulnerability tasks is far from sufficient for security assurance. More
than half of the ground-truth vulnerabilities go undetected even by the best agent, and the detection rate drops further
on vulnerabilities that involve cross-contract interactions or protocol-specific logic. Developers who rely solely on AI
agent scans risk a false sense of security.
There is also a dimension that neither EVMbench nor our evaluation measures: false positives. Both benchmarks
score only recall (how many real vulnerabilities the agent finds) without penalizing false reports. In practice, an agent
that reports 20 findings where only 3 are real creates more work than it saves. Until benchmarks incorporate precision-
aware scoring, the reported detection rates likely overstate practical usefulness. This gap further reinforces that AI
agents should complement, not replace, existing security practices in the development workflow.

7.2 AI Agents for Audit Firms

For professional audit firms, AI agents offer a different value proposition. Agents are not a replacement for human
auditors, but they can serve as a first-pass filter that triages easy vulnerabilities before human review begins. Our
results show that agents reliably detect well-known patterns: missing access controls, straightforward reentrancy, and
arithmetic flaws are caught by most configurations. Letting agents handle these frees human auditors to focus on the
harder, protocol-specific vulnerabilities that agents consistently miss.
This workflow goes beyond one-shot scanning and requires human-in-the-loop interaction. Our evaluation (and
EVMbench’s) runs each agent once on each task without feedback. In practice, auditors could guide agents with
protocol context, ask follow-up questions about suspicious findings, or iteratively refine the agent’s focus. EVMbench’s
hint experiments support this: when GPT-5.2 receives mechanism-level hints, its exploit score rises from 62.5% to 76.4%;
with additional grading-level hints, it reaches 95.8% [ 1 ]. Agents respond well to human-provided context, and the more
specific the guidance, the better they perform.
This points to a human-in-the-loop agentic workflow as the likely end state for security auditing. Audit firms that
continuously track real-world attack incidents [ 25 ] and emerging exploit techniques [ 26 ] can feed this knowledge
directly into agent prompts, substantially improving detection capability. The combination of a firm’s accumulated
security insights with an agent’s ability to systematically scan large codebases creates a workflow where neither side
works alone. Human auditors supply the protocol-specific context and adversarial intuition that agents lack, while
agents handle the breadth of code review that humans find tedious. This human-in-the-loop agentic approach is where
AI agents can most effectively improve smart contract security today, and fully autonomous scanning is not yet a viable
alternative.

7.3 Implications for Evaluation Methodology

Our findings also reveal limitations in how AI agents for smart contract security are currently evaluated.
Rankings are not stable. Model rankings shift across tasks (Detect vs. Exploit), datasets (EVMbench vs. Inci-
dents), and scaffolds (vendor vs. OpenCode). Drawing model-level conclusions from a single dataset with a single
scaffold, as EVMbench does, can be misleading. Future evaluations should treat scaffolding and reasoning effort as
controlled variables.
Curated benchmarks overestimate real-world capability. The 0% exploit rate on real-world incidents (vs. 61.1%
on curated tasks) is a stark gap. Part of this reflects our stricter evaluation setting (forked production state, no hints, net-
profit requirement), but it also points to a real capability limitation: agents lack the protocol-specific context needed
for end-to-end exploitation in production environments.
Precision matters. Both EVMbench and our evaluation measure only recall. Adding false-positive penalties would
produce scores closer to practical usefulness and help distinguish agents that find real vulnerabilities from those that
over-report.

8 Limitations

Both EVMbench and our extended evaluation have methodological limitations that affect how results should be in-
terpreted. We group these into three categories: dataset limitations, evaluation design limitations, and infrastructure
limitations.
Dataset limitations. The EVMbench dataset contains 120 vulnerabilities from 40 repositories; our Incidents
dataset adds 22. Neither covers every vulnerability type: cross-chain interactions and zero-knowledge circuits are
absent, and ground-truth descriptions may contain errors that affect grading. We argue that most EVMbench tasks
may be in model training data, but we do not provide direct evidence of memorization. Our Incidents dataset avoids
this concern by design, but with only 22 incidents its statistical power is limited.
Evaluation design limitations. Agent evaluation is expensive, so most configurations are tested in a single trial.
We do not report confidence intervals or measure variance across random seeds; future work should run multiple trials
with bootstrapped confidence intervals. Our cross-scaffold analysis covers three models on Detect only. Although the
pattern is consistent (OpenCode outperforms in five of six comparisons), the evidence comes from single-trial runs,
and more models, tasks, and trials are needed to confirm generality. The model-based Detect grader can only check
for vulnerabilities already identified by human auditors; it cannot credit valid new findings absent from the ground
truth, and it does not penalize false positives, so agents could score well by over-reporting.
Infrastructure limitations. All model calls go through OpenRouter^7 rather than vendor APIs. Recent work has
shown that third-party API providers may serve models that differ from what they claim, with up to 47% perfor-
mance variation and 46% fingerprint test failures compared to official services [ 30 ]. While OpenRouter is a widely
used provider, we cannot fully rule out such discrepancies. Each task also has a container time limit, and some failures
may reflect timeouts rather than capability limitations.

Security Benchmarks. CTF challenge suites [ 6 ], CVE-based benchmarks [ 7 ], and large-scale vulnerability repro-

age and real-world incidents. Traditional tools such as Slither [ 22 ], Mythril [ 23 ], and Securify [ 24 ] handle well-defined
vulnerability classes but cannot reason about application-specific logic flaws [ 10 , 11 ].
LLM-Based Vulnerability Detection. GPTScan [ 12 ] combines GPT with static analysis; PropertyGPT [ 15 ] gener-
ates formal verification properties via RAG; SmartInv [ 16 ] infers contract invariants through multimodal learning; iAu-
dit [ 17 ] combines fine-tuning with LLM-based agents. These build specialized pipelines. We evaluate general-purpose
agents without task-specific tooling, measuring out-of-the-box capabilities.

10 Conclusion

Through an extended evaluation of 26 agent configurations on EVMbench and a contamination-free Incidents dataset
of 22 real-world security incidents, we find that agents have real but bounded capability. The best agent detects 47.5%
of curated benchmark vulnerabilities (Table 5 ) and 65% of real-world incident vulnerabilities (Table 8 ), showing that
AI can already catch a meaningful fraction of security issues. At the same time, more than half of vulnerabilities go
undetected, model rankings shift across tasks and datasets, scaffold choice alone can swing scores by up to 5 percentage
points (Figure 1 ), and no agent can exploit any of the 22 real-world incidents end-to-end (0/110 pairs, Section 5 ). Neither
EVMbench nor our evaluation penalizes false positives, so the practical gap is likely even wider than these numbers
suggest.
For the smart contract security industry, these results point to a clear direction. A 47.5% detection ceiling and 0% real-
world exploit rate mean fully autonomous AI auditing cannot yet replace human judgment. At the same time, agents
reliably detect well-known patterns (six of 22 incidents caught by all agents), and EVMbench’s hint experiments show
that human-provided context raises exploit scores from 62.5% to 95.8%.
We believe the path forward is a human-in-the-loop agentic workflow. AI agents handle the breadth of code scanning
and flag common vulnerability patterns, while human auditors contribute the protocol-specific knowledge, adversarial
reasoning, and judgment that agents lack. Security firms that invest in structured knowledge bases, continuously
tracking attack incidents, cataloging exploit techniques, and encoding domain expertise into agent workflows, will
turn AI from a blunt instrument into a force multiplier. The smart contract security industry should focus on building
the infrastructure to make humans and AI work together effectively.
