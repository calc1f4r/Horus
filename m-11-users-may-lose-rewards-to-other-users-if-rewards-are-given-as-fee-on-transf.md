## Vulnerability Title

[M-11] Users may lose rewards to other users if rewards are given as fee-on-transfer tokens

### Overview


A bug has been reported in the BAL protocol, which also affects the Aura protocol, regarding rewards given in fee-on-transfer tokens. If these rewards are given, users may get no rewards and the functionality of the protocol will break. This is because the total amount available to be transferred later will be less than the amount passed in due to the fee taken by the token itself. This can be seen in the ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L87-L98 code. 

Consider the following scenario: User A holds 98% of the total supply of vlBAL, User B holds 1%, and User C holds 1%. If a fee is charged, User A will get 98% of the reward, leaving 0 wei of the token left, and when Users B and C try to claim their rewards the call will revert since there is no balance left. This could lead to users becoming angry and stop using Aura. 

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to measure the contract balance before and after the transfer, and use the difference as the amount, rather than the stated amount. This bug was disputed by 0xMaharishi (Aura Finance) who stated that this contract is optional to use and is not supposed to support fee bearing tokens. However, LSDan (judge) commented that this should be protected against in the scenarios where it could cause an issue, as it requires external factors and relies on hypothetical attack motivation.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by Aits, BowTiedWardens, and MaratCerby_

If rewards are given in fee-on-transfer tokens, users may get no rewards, breaking functionality.

`Med: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or :::leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions:::, but external requirements.`
(emphasis mine)

The underlying BAL protocol support fee-on-transfer tokens, so should Aura.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
File: contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol   #1

87       function _addReward(
88           address _token,
89           uint256 _amount,
90           uint256 _epoch
91       ) internal nonReentrant {
92           // Pull before reward accrual
93           IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
94   
95           //convert to reward per token
96           uint256 supply = auraLocker.totalSupplyAtEpoch(_epoch);
97           uint256 rPerT = (_amount * 1e20) / supply;
98           rewardData[_token][_epoch] += rPerT;
```

[ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L87-L98](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L87-L98)<br>

If a fee is charged the total amount available to be transferred later will be less than the `_amount` passed in.

Consider the following scenario:<br>
User A holds 98% of the total supply of vlBAL (the system is being bootstrapped)<br>
User B holds 1%<br>
User C holds 1%

1.  `_token` is given out as a reward. It is a fee-on-transfer token with a fee of 2%
2.  Nobody claims the reward until it's fully available (to save gas on transaction fees)
3.  User A is the first to claim his/her reward and gets 98% of the reward, leaving 0 wei of the token left (since the other 2% was already taken as a fee by the token itself)
4.  User B tries to claim and the call reverts since there's no balance left
5.  User C tries to claim and the call reverts for them too
6.  Users B and C are angry and stop using Aura

```solidity
File: contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol   #2

87       function _addReward(
88           address _token,
89           uint256 _amount,
90           uint256 _epoch
91       ) internal nonReentrant {
92           // Pull before reward accrual
93           IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
94   
95           //convert to reward per token
96           uint256 supply = auraLocker.totalSupplyAtEpoch(_epoch);
97           uint256 rPerT = (_amount * 1e20) / supply;
98           rewardData[_token][_epoch] += rPerT;
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Measure the contract balance before and after the transfer, and use the difference as the amount, rather than the stated amount.

**[0xMaharishi (Aura Finance) disputed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/176#issuecomment-1138718030):**
 > This contract is optional to use - it is not supposed to support fee bearing tokens.

**[LSDan (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/176#issuecomment-1179232751):**
 > See my comment on issue [#18](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/18): "There are several cases in the code reported where the token in question comes from an external (non-admin, non-protocol) source. One of these is the addReward functionality (ExtraRewards). This would indeed cause an accounting issue and allow a potential malicious actor to send rewards which cause distribution to fail due to lack of funds. Just because you don't plan to use fee on transfer tokens, does not mean they will not be used. This should be protected against in the scenarios where it could cause an issue.

 > That said, this clearly requires external factors and relies on hypothetical attack motivation that seems unlikely to me. I think it should be included as a medium risk."
