## Vulnerability Title

[L-04] Missing validation for identical base and quote Tokens in market

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content


_Acknowledged_

The `checkMarketParams` function fails to validate that `baseToken` and `quoteToken` are different addresses when creating a new market. This allows the creation of markets where both tokens are identical, which would result in a dysfunctional market with meaningless price calculations and swap operations.

It's recommended to add a validation check to ensure `baseToken` and `quoteToken` are different.
