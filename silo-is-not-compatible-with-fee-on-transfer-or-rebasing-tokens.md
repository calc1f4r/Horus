## Vulnerability Title

Silo is not compatible with Fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens

### Overview


This bug report discusses an issue with the Silo protocol where it is not compatible with Fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens. These tokens cannot be added to the Deposit Whitelist via Beanstalk governance, as the protocol does not properly account for tokens that shift balance when received or over time. This can have a high impact on the functionality of the protocol. The report recommends either clearly stating in the documentation that these tokens will not be implemented, or adjusting the code to check the token balance before and after any related operations.

## Summary

According to the documentation there are certain conditions that need to be met for a token to be whitelisted:

```
Additional tokens may be added to the Deposit Whitelist via Beanstalk governance. In order for a token to be added to the Deposit Whitelist, Beanstalk requires:
1. The token address;
2. A function to calculate the Bean Denominated Value (BDV) of the token (see Section 14.2 of the whitepaper for complete formulas); and
3. The number of Stalk and Seeds per BDV received upon Deposit.
```

Thus if the community proposes any kind of Fee-on-Transfer or rebasing tokens like (`PAXG` or `stETH`) and the Beanstalk governance approves it, then the protocol needs to integrate them into the system. But as it is now the system is definitely not compatible with such tokens.

## Vulnerability Details

`deposit`, `depositWithBDV`, `addDepositToAccount`, `removeDepositFromAccount` and any other `silo` accounting related functions perform operations using inputed/recorded amounts. They don't query the existing balance of tokens before or after receiving/sending in order to properly account for tokens that shift balance when received (FoT) or shift balance over time (rebasing).

## Impact

Likelyhood - low/medium - At the moment of writing lido has over [31% of the ETH staked](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking) which makes `stETH` a very popular token. There's a strong chance that stakeholder would want to have stETH inside the silo.

Impact - High - It simply won't work.

Overall severity is medium.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommendations

Clearly state in the docs that weird tokens won't be implemented via Governance Vote or adjust the code to check the `token.balanceOf()` before and after doing any operation related to the `silo`.
