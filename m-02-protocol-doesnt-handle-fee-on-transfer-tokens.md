## Vulnerability Title

[M-02] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens

### Overview


A bug has been identified in the code for NFTLoanFacilitator.sol. The code allows the borrower to specify any asset token, which can lead to a point of failure on the original `lend()` call if the transfer fee % of the asset token is larger than the origination fee %. This is a medium severity vulnerability as it can impact core protocol functionality. A proof of concept has been provided to demonstrate the issue, and other considerations have been discussed. 

To mitigate this issue, the protocol can either calculate the origination fee based on the requested loan amount, or calculate the amount received from the initial transfer and use this to calculate the origination fee. The former option will allow the lender to send a greater value so that `feeOnTransfer <= originationFee`, while the latter will result in the borrower receiving less than the desired loan amount. Manual review was used to identify the issue.

### Original Finding Content

_Submitted by 0xDjango, also found by cccz, csanuragjain, Dravee, IllIllI, robee, and Ruhum_

[NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L155-L160](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed/blob/e8015d7c4b295af131f017e646ba1b99c8f608f0/contracts/NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L155-L160)<br>

Since the borrower is able to specify any asset token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.

It is my belief that this is a medium severity vulnerability due to its ability to impact core protocol functionality.

### Proof of Concept

For the first lender to call `lend()`, if the transfer fee % of the asset token is larger than the origination fee %, the second transfer will fail in the following code:

```solidity
ERC20(loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 facilitatorTake = amount * originationFeeRate / SCALAR;
ERC20(loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransfer(
    IERC721(borrowTicketContract).ownerOf(loanId),
    amount - facilitatorTake
);
```

Example:

*   `originationFee = 2%` Max fee is 5% per comments

*   `feeOnTransfer = 3%`

*   `amount = 100 tokens`

*   Lender transfers `amount`

*   `NFTLoanFacilitator` receives `97`.

*   `facilitatorTake = 2`

*   `NFTLoanFacilitator` attempts to send `100 - 2` to borrower, but only has `97`.

*   Execution reverts.

#### Other considerations:

If the originationFee is less than or equal to the transferFee, the transfers will succeed but will be received at a loss for the borrower and lender. Specifically for the lender, it might be unwanted functionality for a lender to lend 100 and receive 97 following a successful repayment (excluding interest for this example).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Since the `originationFee` is calculated based on the `amount` sent by the lender, this calculation will always underflow given the example above. Instead, a potential solution would be to calculate the `originationFee` based on the requested loan amount, allowing the lender to send a greater value so that `feeOnTransfer <= originationFee`.

Oppositely, the protocol can instead calculate the amount received from the initial transfer and use this amount to calculate the `originationFee`. The issue with this option is that the borrower will receive less than the desired loan amount.

 > If `amount - origination_fee - token_fee < 0`, then yeah you will not be able to underwrite to loan. But that would be a huge fee.

 > Discussed more with warden 0xDjango, if the token even has a 1% fee then the second transfer will fail OR we will leak facilitator funds, although this is sort of impossible because currently none of the transactions with these fee on transfer tokens will work.

> This issue is slightly different from others that just point out that borrowers will get `amount - token_fee`. The only one I have seen, I think, to point out that fulfilling loans with fee on transfer tokens is impossible.<br>

> Imagine a token that takes 1% on transfer.<br>
> Amount = 100<br>
> 99 reaches facilitator<br>
> facilitator transfers 100 - facilitator take = 99 to the borrower.<br>
> Facilitator gets nothing<br>
> Borrower gets 98.<br>
> 
> If the facilitator take is greater or the fee on transfer take is greater, it won't work at all.<br>
> 
> Med severity is maybe right given we can miss out on origination fees?
