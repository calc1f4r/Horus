## Vulnerability Title

A missing zero address check

### Overview

See description below for full details.

### Original Finding Content

##### Description
There is an issue in the following functions - https://github.com/p2p-org/eth-staking-fee-distributor-contracts/blob/30a7ff78e8285f2eae4ae552efb390aa4453a083/contracts/feeDistributor/ContractWcFeeDistributor.sol#L181, https://github.com/p2p-org/eth-staking-fee-distributor-contracts/blob/30a7ff78e8285f2eae4ae552efb390aa4453a083/contracts/feeDistributor/ElOnlyFeeDistributor.sol#L83 and https://github.com/p2p-org/eth-staking-fee-distributor-contracts/blob/30a7ff78e8285f2eae4ae552efb390aa4453a083/contracts/feeDistributor/OracleFeeDistributor.sol#L187.
There is a missing check for the `_to` address value.
The LOW severity level was assigned to that issue because it is possible to send funds to zero address.

##### Recommendation
We recommend adding the following check `require(_to != address(0))` to the mentioned functions.
