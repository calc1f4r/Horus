## Vulnerability Title

Centralization Risk

### Overview


This report highlights four different sections in the code where strict checks are not implemented. This means that certain conditions are not being checked properly, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities. These sections include the withdraw_v2 function, deposit function, SyncSpace function, and _withdrawERC20 and _withdrawERC1155 functions. The lack of checks in these sections could allow attackers to manipulate the code and potentially gain access to funds or increase the amount in the locker without locking their own tokens. To resolve these issues, it is recommended to add validation checks and utilize a canonical bump instead of relying on user input. These changes have been accepted and incorporated into the off-chain code.

### Original Finding Content

## Analysis of Transaction Handling

There are a few sections where strict checks are not implemented since every transaction requires an admin signature and is validated off-chain.

1. **withdraw_v2**: This function receives the `final_amount` and utilizes it to specify the remaining amount in the locker after the withdrawal. However, it does not check if `final_amount` is less than or equal to `locker.amounts - withdraw_amount`.

2. **deposit**: This function transfers tokens from `user_ta` to `vault_ta` for locking and recording the transferred amount in the locker. The validity of `vault_ta` is assessed by verifying the owner and mint. However, this may be bypassed by creating a token account in their program that satisfies the condition. With `vault_ta` under the ownership of the attacker, they may increase the amount in the locker without locking their own tokens.

3. **SyncSpace, _withdrawERC20** and **_withdrawERC1155**: These functions do not include a validation check to ensure that the amount transferred is less than or equal to the user’s balance. It is recommended to add a validation check during the execution of the withdrawal process to ensure that the amount withdrawn is within the limits of the user’s available balance.

4. **Seed Checks**: No seed checks are implemented for `vault_ta` and `burn_ta` in `WithdrawV2`. Additionally, instead of utilizing a canonical bump, they rely on user input. This may result in the scattering of funds across multiple token accounts as users exploit multiple valid bumps within a set of seeds.

## Remediation

1. Verify that `final_amount <= vault.amount - withdraw_amount`.
2. Include a seed check for `vault_ta` in the `WithdrawV2` instruction. This guarantees that the token account utilized for the withdrawal is associated with the correct program, preventing manipulation by an attacker.
3. Validate if the amount is less than or equal to the balance.
4. Utilize a canonical bump instead of user input and check the seeds.

## Patch

The reported issues have been accepted by mentioning corresponding checks for them and incorporated into the off-chain.
